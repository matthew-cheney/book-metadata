    "body": "\nABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,\nand presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The\nSunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and\noccupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt\nPolly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her--Tom being placed next\nthe aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window\nand the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up\nthe aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;\nthe mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other\nunnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair,\nsmart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill\nmansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much\nthe most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could\nboast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the\nnew notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by\na troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all\nthe young clerks in town in a body--for they had stood in the vestibule\nsucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering\nadmirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came\nthe Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as\nif she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was\nthe pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so\ngood. And besides, he had been \u201cthrown up to them\u201d so much. His\nwhite handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on\nSundays--accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys\nwho had as snobs.\n\nThe congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,\nto warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the\nchurch which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the\nchoir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all\nthrough service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,\nbut I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,\nand I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in\nsome foreign country.\n\nThe minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a\npeculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His\nvoice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a\ncertain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word\nand then plunged down as if from a spring-board:\n\nShall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry _beds_ of ease,\n\nWhilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' _blood_-y seas?\n\nHe was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church \u201csociables\u201d he was\nalways called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies\nwould lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,\nand \u201cwall\u201d their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, \u201cWords\ncannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal\nearth.\u201d\n\nAfter the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into\na bulletin-board, and read off \u201cnotices\u201d of meetings and societies and\nthings till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of\ndoom--a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,\naway here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is\nto justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.\n\nAnd now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went\ninto details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the\nchurch; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;\nfor the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United\nStates; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the\nPresident; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed\nby stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of\nEuropean monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light\nand the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear\nwithal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with\na supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace\nand favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a\ngrateful harvest of good. Amen.\n\nThere was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.\nThe boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he\nonly endured it--if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;\nhe kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously--for he was not\nlistening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman's regular\nroute over it--and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,\nhis ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered\nadditions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had\nlit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by\ncalmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and\npolishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with\nthe body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping\nits wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they\nhad been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if\nit knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's\nhands itched to grab for it they did not dare--he believed his soul would\nbe instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going\non. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal\nforward; and the instant the \u201cAmen\u201d was out the fly was a prisoner of\nwar. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.\n\nThe minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an\nargument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod--and\nyet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and\nthinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly\nworth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he\nalways knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything\nelse about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested\nfor a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the\nassembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when the lion\nand the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead\nthem. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle\nwere lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the\nprincipal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the\nthought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,\nif it was a tame lion.\n\nNow he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.\nPresently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was\na large black beetle with formidable jaws--a \u201cpinchbug,\u201d he called it. It\nwas in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to\ntake him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went\nfloundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went\ninto the boy's mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,\nunable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out\nof his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in\nthe beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came\nidling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the\nquiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the\ndrooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around\nit; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew\nbolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly\nsnatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy\nthe diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,\nand continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent\nand absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin\ndescended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,\na flirt of the poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards\naway, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators\nshook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and\nhand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,\nand probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a\ncraving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on\nit again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his\nfore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at\nit with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But\nhe grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a\nfly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close\nto the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the\nbeetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony\nand the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so\ndid the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew\ndown the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the\nhome-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was\nbut a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of\nlight. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang\ninto its master's lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of\ndistress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.\n\nBy this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with\nsuppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.\nThe discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all\npossibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest\nsentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of\nunholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson\nhad said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole\ncongregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.\n\nTom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was\nsome satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety\nin it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog\nshould play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in\nhim to carry it off."
