    "body": "\nTHERE was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed Tom, that\nswept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He\nstarted to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the\nhead of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a\nmoment's hesitation he ran to her and said:\n\n\u201cI acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever, ever\ndo that way again, as long as ever I live--please make up, won't you?\u201d\n\nThe girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:\n\n\u201cI'll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I'll\nnever speak to you again.\u201d\n\nShe tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not\neven presence of mind enough to say \u201cWho cares, Miss Smarty?\u201d until the\nright time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a\nfine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were\na boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently\nencountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled\none in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in\nher hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to \u201ctake in,\u201d\n she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.\nIf she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom's\noffensive fling had driven it entirely away.\n\nPoor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.\nThe master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied\nambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but\npoverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village\nschoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and\nabsorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept\nthat book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was\nperishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy\nand girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories\nwere alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.\nNow, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she\nnoticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She\nglanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the\nbook in her hands. The titlepage--Professor Somebody's _Anatomy_--carried\nno information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at\nonce upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece--a human figure,\nstark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer\nstepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky\nsnatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the\npictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk,\nturned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.\n\n\u201cTom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person\nand look at what they're looking at.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I know you was looking at anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're\ngoing to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be\nwhipped, and I never was whipped in school.\u201d\n\nThen she stamped her little foot and said:\n\n\u201c_Be_ so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to happen.\nYou just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!\u201d--and she flung\nout of the house with a new explosion of crying.\n\nTom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said\nto himself:\n\n\u201cWhat a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in\nschool! Shucks! What's a licking! That's just like a girl--they're so\nthin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain't going to tell\nold Dobbins on this little fool, because there's other ways of getting\neven on her, that ain't so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask\nwho it was tore his book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do just the way\nhe always does--ask first one and then t'other, and when he comes to the\nright girl he'll know it, without any telling. Girls' faces always tell\non them. They ain't got any backbone. She'll get licked. Well, it's a\nkind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain't any way\nout of it.\u201d Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: \u201cAll\nright, though; she'd like to see me in just such a fix--let her sweat it\nout!\u201d\n\nTom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the\nmaster arrived and school \u201ctook in.\u201d Tom did not feel a strong interest\nin his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls' side of the\nroom Becky's face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want\nto pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get\nup no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the\nspelling-book discovery was made, and Tom's mind was entirely full\nof his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her\nlethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She\ndid not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he\nspilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only\nseemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad\nof that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she\nwas not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse\nto get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced\nherself to keep still--because, said she to herself, \u201che'll tell about me\ntearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not to save his life!\u201d\n\nTom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all\nbroken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly\nupset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout--he\nhad denied it for form's sake and because it was custom, and had stuck\nto the denial from principle.\n\nA whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air\nwas drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened\nhimself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,\nbut seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the\npupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched\nhis movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently\nfor a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!\nTom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit\nlook as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot\nhis quarrel with her. Quick--something must be done! done in a flash,\ntoo! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.\nGood!--he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring\nthrough the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little\ninstant, and the chance was lost--the master opened the volume. If Tom\nonly had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help\nfor Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.\nEvery eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even\nthe innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten--the\nmaster was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: \u201cWho tore this book?\u201d\n\nThere was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness\ncontinued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.\n\n\u201cBenjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?\u201d\n\nA denial. Another pause.\n\n\u201cJoseph Harper, did you?\u201d\n\nAnother denial. Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the\nslow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of\nboys--considered a while, then turned to the girls:\n\n\u201cAmy Lawrence?\u201d\n\nA shake of the head.\n\n\u201cGracie Miller?\u201d\n\nThe same sign.\n\n\u201cSusan Harper, did you do this?\u201d\n\nAnother negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling\nfrom head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the\nsituation.\n\n\u201cRebecca Thatcher\u201d [Tom glanced at her face--it was white with\nterror]--\u201cdid you tear--no, look me in the face\u201d [her hands rose in\nappeal]--\u201cdid you tear this book?\u201d\n\nA thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to his feet\nand shouted--\u201cI done it!\u201d\n\nThe school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a\nmoment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward\nto go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that\nshone upon him out of poor Becky's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred\nfloggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without\nan outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever\nadministered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a\ncommand to remain two hours after school should be dismissed--for he\nknew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not\ncount the tedious time as loss, either.\n\nTom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for\nwith shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own\ntreachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to\npleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky's latest words\nlingering dreamily in his ear--\n\n\u201cTom, how _could_ you be so noble!\u201d"
