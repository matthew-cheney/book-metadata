    "body": "\nWITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of\nmen were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the ferryboat, well filled\nwith passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore\nJudge Thatcher.\n\nWhen the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in\nthe dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,\ndead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing\neyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer\nof the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own\nexperience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but\nnevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,\nwhich revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated\nbefore how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day\nhe lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.\n\nInjun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great\nfoundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with\ntedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a\nsill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought\nno effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there\nhad been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless\nstill, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have\nsqueezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked\nthat place in order to be doing something--in order to pass the weary\ntime--in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could\nfind half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this\nvestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner\nhad searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a\nfew bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The\npoor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a\nstalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded\nby the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off\nthe stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had\nscooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once\nin every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick--a\ndessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling\nwhen the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome\nwere laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the\nBritish empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was\n\u201cnews.\u201d\n\nIt is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall\nhave sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition,\nand been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a\npurpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand\nyears to be ready for this flitting human insect's need? and has it\nanother important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No\nmatter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped\nout the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist\nstares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when\nhe comes to see the wonders of McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands\nfirst in the list of the cavern's marvels; even \u201cAladdin's Palace\u201d\n cannot rival it.\n\nInjun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked\nthere in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and\nhamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and\nall sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as\nsatisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the\nhanging.\n\nThis funeral stopped the further growth of one thing--the petition to the\ngovernor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had been largely signed;\nmany tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of\nsappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the\ngovernor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty\nunder foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the\nvillage, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would\nhave been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a\npardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired\nand leaky water-works.\n\nThe morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have\nan important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the\nWelshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned\nthere was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted\nto talk about now. Huck's face saddened. He said:\n\n\u201cI know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but\nwhiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben\nyou, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you\nhadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way or other and\ntold me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something's always\ntold me we'd never get holt of that swag.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern\nwas all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you remember you\nwas to watch there that night?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night that I\nfollered Injun Joe to the widder's.\u201d\n\n\u201c_You_ followed him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes--but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him, and\nI don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn't\nben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all right.\u201d\n\nThen Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only\nheard of the Welshman's part of it before.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, \u201cwhoever\nnipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon--anyways\nit's a goner for us, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. \u201cTom, have you got on\nthe track of that money again?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, it's in the cave!\u201d\n\nHuck's eyes blazed.\n\n\u201cSay it again, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe money's in the cave!\u201d\n\n\u201cTom--honest injun, now--is it fun, or earnest?\u201d\n\n\u201cEarnest, Huck--just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in\nthere with me and help get it out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not\nget lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the\nworld.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood as wheat! What makes you think the money's--\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll\nagree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the world. I will,\nby jings.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right--it's a whiz. When do you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,\nnow, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom--least I don't think I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,\nbut there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me know\nabout. Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll float the skiff\ndown there, and I'll pull it back again all by myself. You needn't ever\nturn your hand over.\u201d\n\n\u201cLess start right off, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little\nbag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled\nthings they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's the time I wished I\nhad some when I was in there before.\u201d\n\nA trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who\nwas absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles\nbelow \u201cCave Hollow,\u201d Tom said:\n\n\u201cNow you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the\ncave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see\nthat white place up yonder where there's been a landslide? Well, that's\none of my marks. We'll get ashore, now.\u201d\n\nThey landed.\n\n\u201cNow, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out\nof with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.\u201d\n\nHuck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly\nmarched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:\n\n\u201cHere you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this country.\nYou just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to be a robber,\nbut I knew I'd got to have a thing like this, and where to run across\nit was the bother. We've got it now, and we'll keep it quiet, only we'll\nlet Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in--because of course there's got to be a\nGang, or else there wouldn't be any style about it. Tom Sawyer's Gang--it\nsounds splendid, don't it, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, most anybody. Waylay people--that's mostly the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd kill them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's a ransom?\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and after\nyou've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them. That's\nthe general way. Only you don't kill the women. You shut up the women,\nbut you don't kill them. They're always beautiful and rich, and awfully\nscared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat\noff and talk polite. They ain't anybody as polite as robbers--you'll see\nthat in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they've\nbeen in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that\nyou couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd turn right\naround and come back. It's so in all the books.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a pirate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses\nand all that.\u201d\n\nBy this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in\nthe lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then\nmade their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought\nthem to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.\nHe showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay\nagainst the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame\nstruggle and expire.\n\nThe boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and\ngloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently\nentered and followed Tom's other corridor until they reached the\n\u201cjumping-off place.\u201d The candles revealed the fact that it was not\nreally a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet\nhigh. Tom whispered:\n\n\u201cNow I'll show you something, Huck.\u201d\n\nHe held his candle aloft and said:\n\n\u201cLook as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There--on the\nbig rock over yonder--done with candle-smoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, it's a _cross_!\u201d\n\n\u201c_Now_ where's your Number Two? '_under the cross_,' hey? Right yonder's\nwhere I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!\u201d\n\nHuck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:\n\n\u201cTom, less git out of here!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! and leave the treasure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes--leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there, certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where he\ndied--away out at the mouth of the cave--five mile from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of\nghosts, and so do you.\u201d\n\nTom began to fear that Huck was right. Mis-givings gathered in his mind.\nBut presently an idea occurred to him--\n\n\u201cLookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun Joe's\nghost ain't a going to come around where there's a cross!\u201d\n\nThe point was well taken. It had its effect.\n\n\u201cTom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that\ncross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.\u201d\n\nTom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.\nHuck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the\ngreat rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.\nThey found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with\na pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some\nbacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there\nwas no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in\nvain. Tom said:\n\n\u201cHe said _under_ the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the\ncross. It can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the\nground.\u201d\n\nThey searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck\ncould suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:\n\n\u201cLookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle-grease on the clay\nabout one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what's\nthat for? I bet you the money _is_ under the rock. I'm going to dig in\nthe clay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ain't no bad notion, Tom!\u201d said Huck with animation.\n\nTom's \u201creal Barlow\u201d was out at once, and he had not dug four inches\nbefore he struck wood.\n\n\u201cHey, Huck!--you hear that?\u201d\n\nHuck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and\nremoved. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.\nTom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he\ncould, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed\nto explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended\ngradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to\nthe left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and\nexclaimed:\n\n\u201cMy goodness, Huck, lookyhere!\u201d\n\nIt was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,\nalong with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two\nor three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish\nwell soaked with the water-drip.\n\n\u201cGot it at last!\u201d said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with\nhis hand. \u201cMy, but we're rich, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe, but\nwe _have_ got it, sure! Say--let's not fool around here. Let's snake it\nout. Lemme see if I can lift the box.\u201d\n\nIt weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward\nfashion, but could not carry it conveniently.\n\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d he said; \u201c_They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day\nat the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of\nfetching the little bags along.\u201d\n\nThe money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross\nrock.\n\n\u201cNow less fetch the guns and things,\u201d said Huck.\n\n\u201cNo, Huck--leave them there. They're just the tricks to have when we\ngo to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our\norgies there, too. It's an awful snug place for orgies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat orgies?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got to\nhave them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's\ngetting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke when we get\nto the skiff.\u201d\n\nThey presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily\nout, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the\nskiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got\nunder way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting\ncheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.\n\n\u201cNow, Huck,\u201d said Tom, \u201cwe'll hide the money in the loft of the widow's\nwoodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it and divide,\nand then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be\nsafe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook\nBenny Taylor's little wagon; I won't be gone a minute.\u201d\n\nHe disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small\nsacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,\ndragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman's\nhouse, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the\nWelshman stepped out and said:\n\n\u201cHallo, who's that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck and Tom Sawyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.\nHere--hurry up, trot ahead--I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's not as\nlight as it might be. Got bricks in it?--or old metal?\u201d\n\n\u201cOld metal,\u201d said Tom.\n\n\u201cI judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away\nmore time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry\nthan they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that's\nhuman nature--hurry along, hurry along!\u201d\n\nThe boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.\n\n\u201cNever mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'.\u201d\n\nHuck said with some apprehension--for he was long used to being falsely\naccused:\n\n\u201cMr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing.\u201d\n\nThe Welshman laughed.\n\n\u201cWell, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that. Ain't you\nand the widow good friends?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?\u201d\n\nThis question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind before he\nfound himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas' drawing-room.\nMr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.\n\nThe place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence\nin the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the\nRogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great\nmany more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys\nas heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They\nwere covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson\nwith humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered\nhalf as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:\n\n\u201cTom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and\nHuck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you did just right,\u201d said the widow. \u201cCome with me, boys.\u201d\n\nShe took them to a bedchamber and said:\n\n\u201cNow wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of\nclothes--shirts, socks, everything complete. They're Huck's--no, no\nthanks, Huck--Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they'll fit both\nof you. Get into them. We'll wait--come down when you are slicked up\nenough.\u201d\n\nThen she left."
