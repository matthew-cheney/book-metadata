He saw her\nand they had an exhausting good time playing \u201chispy\u201d and \u201cgully-keeper\u201d\n with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in\na peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint\nthe next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she\nconsented. The child's delight was boundless; and Tom's not more\nmoderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway\nthe young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation\nand pleasurable anticipation. Tom's excitement enabled him to keep\nawake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck's\n\u201cmaow,\u201d and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers\nwith, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.\n\nMorning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and\nrollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and everything was\nready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the\npicnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough\nunder the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young\ngentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was\nchartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main\nstreet laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss\nthe fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.\nThatcher said to Becky, was:\n\n\u201cYou'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all night with\nsome of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any trouble.\u201d\n\nPresently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:\n\n\u201cSay--I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe Harper's we'll\nclimb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas'. She'll have\nice-cream! She has it most every day--dead loads of it. And she'll be\nawful glad to have us.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that will be fun!\u201d\n\nThen Becky reflected a moment and said:\n\n\u201cBut what will mamma say?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow'll she ever know?\u201d\n\nThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:\n\n\u201cI reckon it's wrong--but--\u201d\n\n\u201cBut shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All she\nwants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go there if\nshe'd 'a' thought of it. I know she would!\u201d\n\nThe Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and\nTom's persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say\nnothing to anybody about the night's programme. Presently it occurred to\nTom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The\nthought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he\ncould not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas'. And why should he\ngive it up, he reasoned--the signal did not come the night before, so\nwhy should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the\nevening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined\nto yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of\nthe box of money another time that day.\n\nThree miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody\nhollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest\ndistances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and\nlaughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone\nthrough with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified\nwith responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things\nbegan. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in\nthe shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:\n\n\u201cWho's ready for the cave?\u201d\n\nEverybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there\nwas a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the\nhillside--an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood\nunbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled\nby Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was\nromantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out\nupon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the\nsituation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment\na candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a\nstruggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked\ndown or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a\nnew chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went\nfiling down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of\nlights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of\njunction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than\neight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower\ncrevices branched from it on either hand--for McDougal's cave was but a\nvast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again\nand led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights\ntogether through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never\nfind the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and\nstill down, into the earth, and it was just the same--labyrinth under\nlabyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man \u201cknew\u201d the cave. That was\nan impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it\nwas not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer\nknew as much of the cave as any one.\n\nThe procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of\na mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch\navenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise\nat points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude\neach other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the\n\u201cknown\u201d ground.\n\nBy-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth\nof the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow\ndrippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of\nthe day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking\nno note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had\nbeen calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day's\nadventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat\nwith her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for\nthe wasted time but the captain of the craft.\n\nHuck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat's lights went\nglinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young\npeople were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly\ntired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not\nstop at the wharf--and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his\nattention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten\no'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began\nto wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village\nbetook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the\nsilence and the ghosts. Eleven o'clock came, and the tavern lights were\nput out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long\ntime, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?\nWas there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?\n\nA noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley\ndoor closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next\nmoment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under\nhis arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.\nWhy call Tom now? It would be absurd--the men would get away with the box\nand never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow\nthem; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So\ncommuning with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the\nmen, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough\nahead not to be invisible.\n\nThey moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up\na crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the\npath that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old\nWelshman's house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still\nclimbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.\nBut they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.\nThey plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and\nwere at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his\ndistance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along\nawhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved\non a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that\nhe seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an\nowl came over the hill--ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was\neverything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man\ncleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck's heart shot into his\nthroat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as\nif a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he\nthought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He\nknew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas'\ngrounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won't be hard\nto find.\n\nNow there was a voice--a very low voice--Injun Joe's:\n\n\u201cDamn her, maybe she's got company--there's lights, late as it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can't see any.\u201d\n\nThis was that stranger's voice--the stranger of the haunted house. A\ndeadly chill went to Huck's heart--this, then, was the \u201crevenge\u201d job! His\nthought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been\nkind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder\nher. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn't\ndare--they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in\nthe moment that elapsed between the stranger's remark and Injun Joe's\nnext--which was--\n\n\u201cBecause the bush is in your way. Now--this way--now you see, don't you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and\nmaybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I've told you\nbefore, I don't care for her swag--you may have it. But her husband was\nrough on me--many times he was rough on me--and mainly he was the justice\nof the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain't all. It ain't\na millionth part of it! He had me _horsewhipped_!--horsewhipped in\nfront of the jail, like a nigger!--with all the town looking on!\n_Horsewhipped_!--do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But\nI'll take it out of _her_.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don't kill her! Don't do that!\u201d\n\n\u201cKill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was\nhere; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don't\nkill her--bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils--you notch her\nears like a sow!\u201d\n\n\u201cBy God, that's--\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I'll tie her\nto the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I'll not cry, if\nshe does. My friend, you'll help me in this thing--for _my_ sake--that's\nwhy you're here--I mightn't be able alone. If you flinch, I'll kill you.\nDo you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I'll kill her--and\nthen I reckon nobody'll ever know much about who done this business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if it's got to be done, let's get at it. The quicker the\nbetter--I'm all in a shiver.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it _now_? And company there? Look here--I'll get suspicious of you,\nfirst thing you know. No--we'll wait till the lights are out--there's no\nhurry.\u201d\n\nHuck felt that a silence was going to ensue--a thing still more awful\nthan any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped\ngingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,\none-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one\nside and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same\nelaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and--a twig\nsnapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no\nsound--the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he\nturned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes--turned\nhimself as carefully as if he were a ship--and then stepped quickly but\ncautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and\nso he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he\nreached the Welshman's. He banged at the door, and presently the heads\nof the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.\n\n\u201cWhat's the row there? Who's banging? What do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me in--quick! I'll tell everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuckleberry Finn--quick, let me in!\u201d\n\n\u201cHuckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors, I judge!\nBut let him in, lads, and let's see what's the trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don't ever tell I told you,\u201d were Huck's first words when he got\nin. \u201cPlease don't--I'd be killed, sure--but the widow's been good friends\nto me sometimes, and I want to tell--I _will_ tell if you'll promise you\nwon't ever say it was me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn't act so!\u201d\n exclaimed the old man; \u201cout with it and nobody here'll ever tell, lad.\u201d\n\nThree minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the\nhill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in\ntheir hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great\nbowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and\nthen all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.\n\nHuck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as\nfast as his legs could carry him."
