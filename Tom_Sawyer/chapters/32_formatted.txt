    "body": "\nTUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.\nPetersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public\nprayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer\nthat had the petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good news came\nfrom the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest\nand gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the\nchildren could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great\npart of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her\ncall her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,\nthen lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into\na settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The\nvillage went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.\n\nAway in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village\nbells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad\npeople, who shouted, \u201cTurn out! turn out! they're found! they're found!\u201d\n Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself\nand moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage\ndrawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward\nmarch, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after\nhuzzah!\n\nThe village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the\ngreatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour\na procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's house, seized\nthe saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher's hand, tried to\nspeak but couldn't--and drifted out raining tears all over the place.\n\nAunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so. It\nwould be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the\ngreat news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon\na sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the\nwonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it\nwithal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went\non an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his\nkite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch\nof the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off\nspeck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,\npushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad\nMississippi rolling by!\n\nAnd if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that\nspeck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He\ntold how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told\nhim not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was\ngoing to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and\nconvinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to\nwhere she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way\nout at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried\nfor gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them\nand told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men\ndidn't believe the wild tale at first, \u201cbecause,\u201d said they, \u201cyou are\nfive miles down the river below the valley the cave is in\u201d--then took\nthem aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two\nor three hours after dark and then brought them home.\n\nBefore day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him\nwere tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind\nthem, and informed of the great news.\n\nThree days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to\nbe shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were\nbedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and\nmore tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday,\nwas downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky\ndid not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had\npassed through a wasting illness.\n\nTom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could\nnot be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.\nHe was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his\nadventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by\nto see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event;\nalso that the \u201cragged man's\u201d body had eventually been found in the river\nnear the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape,\nperhaps.\n\nAbout a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started off to\nvisit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting\ntalk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge\nThatcher's house was on Tom's way, and he stopped to see Becky. The\nJudge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him\nironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave again. Tom said he\nthought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said:\n\n\u201cWell, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt.\nBut we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any\nmore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and\ntriple-locked--and I've got the keys.\u201d\n\nTom turned as white as a sheet.\n\n\u201cWhat's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!\u201d\n\nThe water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.\n\n\u201cAh, now you're all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!\u201d"
