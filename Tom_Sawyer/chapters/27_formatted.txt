As he lay\nin the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he\nnoticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away--somewhat as if\nthey had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it\noccurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There\nwas one very strong argument in favor of this idea--namely, that the\nquantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen\nas much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of\nhis age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to\n\u201chundreds\u201d and \u201cthousands\u201d were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that\nno such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for\na moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in\nactual money in any one's possession. If his notions of hidden treasure\nhad been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of\nreal dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.\n\nBut the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer\nunder the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found\nhimself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a\ndream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a\nhurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale\nof a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking\nvery melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If\nhe did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a\ndream.\n\n\u201cHello, Huck!\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, yourself.\u201d\n\nSilence, for a minute.\n\n\u201cTom, if we'd 'a' left the blame tools at the dead tree, we'd 'a' got\nthe money. Oh, ain't it awful!\u201d\n\n\u201c'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.\nDog'd if I don't, Huck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat ain't a dream?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cDream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much dream\nit was! I've had dreams enough all night--with that patch-eyed Spanish\ndevil going for me all through 'em--rot him!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not rot him. _Find_ him! Track the money!\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only one chance for such\na pile--and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty shaky if I was to see him,\nanyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway--and track him out--to his\nNumber Two.\u201d\n\n\u201cNumber Two--yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that. But I can't make\nnothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck--maybe it's the number of a house!\u201d\n\n\u201cGoody!... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this one-horse\ntown. They ain't no numbers here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here--it's the number of a\nroom--in a tavern, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can find out\nquick.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stay here, Huck, till I come.\u201d\n\nTom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck's company in public\nplaces. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.\n2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.\nIn the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper's\nyoung son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody\ngo into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any\nparticular reason for this state of things; had had some little\ncuriosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery\nby entertaining himself with the idea that that room was \u201cha'nted\u201d; had\nnoticed that there was a light in there the night before.\n\n\u201cThat's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No. 2 we're\nafter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cLemme think.\u201d\n\nTom thought a long time. Then he said:\n\n\u201cI'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out\ninto that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap\nof a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and\nI'll nip all of auntie's, and the first dark night we'll go there and\ntry 'em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he\nwas going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get\nhis revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don't go to\nthat No. 2, that ain't the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cLordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you--and if he did,\nmaybe he'd never think anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him. I dono--I dono. I'll\ntry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet I'll follow him, if it's dark, Huck. Why, he might 'a' found\nout he couldn't get his revenge, and be going right after that money.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's so, Tom, it's so. I'll foller him; I will, by jingoes!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you're _talking_! Don't you ever weaken, Huck, and I won't.\u201d"
