    "body": "\nTHE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas\nwandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed\nto him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.\nThere was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.\nThe drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed\nthe soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the\nflaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a\nshimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds\nfloated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible\nbut some cows, and they were asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or\nelse to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.\nHis hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of\ngratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively\nthe percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on\nthe long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that\namounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when\nhe started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and\nmade him take a new direction.\n\nTom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and\nnow he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in\nan instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn\nfriends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a\npin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.\nThe sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were\ninterfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit\nof the tick. So he put Joe's slate on the desk and drew a line down the\nmiddle of it from top to bottom.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cas long as he is on your side you can stir him up and\nI'll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,\nyou're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, go ahead; start him up.\u201d\n\nThe tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe\nharassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This\nchange of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with\nabsorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the\ntwo heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all\nthings else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The\ntick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as\nanxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would\nhave victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would\nbe twitching to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep\npossession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too\nstrong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in\na moment. Said he:\n\n\u201cTom, you let him alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlame it, I ain't going to stir him much.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet him alone, I tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won't!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shall--he's on my side of the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't care whose tick he is--he's on my side of the line, and you\nsha'n't touch him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do what I\nblame please with him, or die!\u201d\n\nA tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders, and its duplicate on\nJoe's; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from\nthe two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been\ntoo absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile\nbefore when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.\nHe had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed\nhis bit of variety to it.\n\nWhen school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered\nin her ear:\n\n\u201cPut on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you get to\nthe corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down through the\nlane and come back. I'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same\nway.\u201d\n\nSo the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with\nanother. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and\nwhen they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they\nsat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil\nand held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising\nhouse. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.\nTom was swimming in bliss. He said:\n\n\u201cDo you love rats?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! I hate them!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I do, too--_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your\nhead with a string.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you must give\nit back to me.\u201d\n\nThat was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs\nagainst the bench in excess of contentment.\n\n\u201cWas you ever at a circus?\u201d said Tom.\n\n\u201cYes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI been to the circus three or four times--lots of times. Church ain't\nshucks to a circus. There's things going on at a circus all the time.\nI'm going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all spotted up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that's so. And they get slathers of money--most a dollar a day, Ben\nRogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, engaged to be married.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like to?\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike? Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you won't\never have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that's\nall. Anybody can do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cKiss? What do you kiss for?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, that, you know, is to--well, they always do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you remember\nwhat I wrote on the slate?\u201d\n\n\u201cYe--yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI sha'n't tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I tell _you_?\u201d\n\n\u201cYe--yes--but some other time.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not now--to-morrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, _now_. Please, Becky--I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it ever so\neasy.\u201d\n\nBecky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about\nher waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to\nher ear. And then he added:\n\n\u201cNow you whisper it to me--just the same.\u201d\n\nShe resisted, for a while, and then said:\n\n\u201cYou turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But you\nmustn't ever tell anybody--_will_ you, Tom? Now you won't, _will_ you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky.\u201d\n\nHe turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred\nhis curls and whispered, \u201cI--love--you!\u201d\n\nThen she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,\nwith Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little\nwhite apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:\n\n\u201cNow, Becky, it's all done--all over but the kiss. Don't you be afraid\nof that--it ain't anything at all. Please, Becky.\u201d And he tugged at her\napron and the hands.\n\nBy and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing\nwith the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and\nsaid:\n\n\u201cNow it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain't\never to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry anybody but me,\never never and forever. Will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry anybody\nbut you--and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly. Of course. That's _part_ of it. And always coming to school\nor when we're going home, you're to walk with me, when there ain't\nanybody looking--and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because\nthat's the way you do when you're engaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's so nice. I never heard of it before.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it's ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence--\u201d\n\nThe big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.\n\n\u201cOh, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to!\u201d\n\nThe child began to cry. Tom said:\n\n\u201cOh, don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you do, Tom--you know you do.\u201d\n\nTom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and\nturned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with\nsoothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was\nup, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and\nuneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping\nshe would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began\nto feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle\nwith him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and\nentered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with\nher face to the wall. Tom's heart smote him. He went to her and stood a\nmoment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:\n\n\u201cBecky, I--I don't care for anybody but you.\u201d\n\nNo reply--but sobs.\n\n\u201cBecky\u201d--pleadingly. \u201cBecky, won't you say something?\u201d\n\nMore sobs.\n\nTom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,\nand passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:\n\n\u201cPlease, Becky, won't you take it?\u201d\n\nShe struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over\nthe hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently\nBecky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she\nflew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:\n\n\u201cTom! Come back, Tom!\u201d\n\nShe listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions\nbut silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid\nherself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she\nhad to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross\nof a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about\nher to exchange sorrows with."
