    "body": "\nTOM was a glittering hero once more--the pet of the old, the envy of the\nyoung. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper\nmagnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet,\nif he escaped hanging.\n\nAs usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom\nand fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort\nof conduct is to the world's credit; therefore it is not well to find\nfault with it.\n\nTom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights\nwere seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always\nwith doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy\nto stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of\nwretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer\nthe night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid\nthat his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding\nInjun Joe's flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.\nThe poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of\nthat? Since Tom's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the\nlawyer's house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had\nbeen sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck's\nconfidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.\n\nDaily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly\nhe wished he had sealed up his tongue.\n\nHalf the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the\nother half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a\nsafe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.\n\nRewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun\nJoe was found. One of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels, a\ndetective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked\nwise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that\ncraft usually achieve. That is to say, he \u201cfound a clew.\u201d But you can't\nhang a \u201cclew\u201d for murder, and so after that detective had got through\nand gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.\n\nThe slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened\nweight of apprehension."
