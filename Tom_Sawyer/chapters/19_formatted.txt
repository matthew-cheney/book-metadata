Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old\nsofty, expecting I'm going to make her believe all that rubbage about\nthat dream, when lo and behold you she'd found out from Joe that you was\nover here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don't know\nwhat is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so\nbad to think you coutextld let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool\nof myself and never say a word.\u201d\n\nThis was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had\nseemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked\nmean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to\nsay for a moment. Then he said:\n\n\u201cAuntie, I wish I hadn't done it--but I didn't think.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your\nown selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from\nJackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could\nthink to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think\nto pity us and save us from sorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAuntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I didn't,\nhonest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you that\nnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you come for, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got\ndrownded.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could\nbelieve you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never\ndid--and I know it, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed and 'deed I did, auntie--I wish I may never stir if I didn't.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, don't lie--don't do it. It only makes things a hundred times\nworse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you from\ngrieving--that was all that made me come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'd give the whole world to believe that--it would cover up a power\nof sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. But it\nain't reasonable; because, why didn't you tell me, child?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all\nfull of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't\nsomehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and\nkept mum.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat bark?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish, now,\nyou'd waked up when I kissed you--I do, honest.\u201d\n\nThe hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned\nin her eyes.\n\n\u201c_Did_ you kiss me, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, yes, I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you did, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, yes, I did, auntie--certain sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you kiss me for, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.\u201d\n\nThe words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in\nher voice when she said:\n\n\u201cKiss me again, Tom!--and be off with you to school, now, and don't\nbother me any more.\u201d\n\nThe moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a\njacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her\nhand, and said to herself:\n\n\u201cNo, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it--but it's a\nblessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort come from it. I hope\nthe Lord--I _know_ the Lord will forgive him, because it was such\ngood-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don't want to find out it's a\nlie. I won't look.\u201d\n\nShe put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out\nher hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more\nshe ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought:\n\u201cIt's a good lie--it's a good lie--I won't let it grieve me.\u201d So she\nsought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom's piece of\nbark through flowing tears and saying: \u201cI could forgive the boy, now, if\nhe'd committed a million sins!\u201d"
