    "body": "\nTHE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with\nhorror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,\napprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump\nthat started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them\ncatch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay\nnear the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give\nwings to their feet.\n\n\u201cIf we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!\u201d whispered\nTom, in short catches between breaths. \u201cI can't stand it much longer.\u201d\n\nHuckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed\ntheir eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.\nThey gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst\nthrough the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering\nshadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:\n\n\u201cHuckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you though?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I _know_ it, Tom.\u201d\n\nTom thought a while, then he said:\n\n\u201cWho'll tell? We?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun Joe\n_didn't_ hang? Why, he'd kill us some time or other, just as dead sure\nas we're a laying here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough. He's\ngenerally drunk enough.\u201d\n\nTom said nothing--went on thinking. Presently he whispered:\n\n\u201cHuck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's the reason he don't know it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you reckon\nhe could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy hokey, that's so, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for _him_!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and\nbesides, he always has. Well, when pap's full, you might take and belt\nhim over the head with a church and you couldn't phase him. He says so,\nhis own self. So it's the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man\nwas dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.\u201d\n\nAfter another reflective silence, Tom said:\n\n\u201cHucky, you sure you can keep mum?\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn't\nmake any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak\n'bout this and they didn't hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take\nand swear to one another--that's what we got to do--swear to keep mum.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm agreed. It's the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear\nthat we--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, that wouldn't do for this. That's good enough for little\nrubbishy common things--specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you\nanyway, and blab if they get in a huff--but there orter be writing 'bout\na big thing like this. And blood.\u201d\n\nTom's whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;\nthe hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.\nHe picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a\nlittle fragment of \u201cred keel\u201d out of his pocket, got the moon on\nhis work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow\ndown-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the\npressure on the up-strokes. [See next page.]\n\n\u201cHuck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They\nwish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.\u201d\n\nHuckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in writing, and\nthe sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and\nwas going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:\n\n\u201cHold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease on\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's verdigrease?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it once--you'll\nsee.\u201d\n\nSo Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked\nthe ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after\nmany squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his\nlittle finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and\nan F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the\nwall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters\nthat bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown\naway.\n\nA figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined\nbuilding, now, but they did not notice it.\n\n\u201cTom,\u201d whispered Huckleberry, \u201cdoes this keep us from _ever_\ntelling--_always_?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it does. It don't make any difference _what_ happens, we got\nto keep mum. We'd drop down dead--don't _you_ know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I reckon that's so.\u201d\n\nThey continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up\na long, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them. The boys\nclasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.\n\n\u201cWhich of us does he mean?\u201d gasped Huckleberry.\n\n\u201cI dono--peep through the crack. Quick!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, _you_, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can't--I can't _do_ it, Huck!\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Tom. There 'tis again!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, lordy, I'm thankful!\u201d whispered Tom. \u201cI know his voice. It's Bull\nHarbison.\u201d *\n\n[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of\nhim as \u201cHarbison's Bull,\u201d but a son or a dog of that name was \u201cBull\nHarbison.\u201d]\n\n\u201cOh, that's good--I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I'd a bet\nanything it was a _stray_ dog.\u201d\n\nThe dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.\n\n\u201cOh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!\u201d whispered Huckleberry. \u201c_Do_,\nTom!\u201d\n\nTom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His\nwhisper was hardly audible when he said:\n\n\u201cOh, Huck, _its a stray dog_!\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, he must mean us both--we're right together.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake 'bout\nwhere _I'll_ go to. I been so wicked.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a\nfeller's told _not_ to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a\ntried--but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever I get off this time,\nI lay I'll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools!\u201d And Tom began to snuffle a\nlittle.\n\n\u201c_You_ bad!\u201d and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. \u201cConsound it, Tom\nSawyer, you're just old pie, 'long-side o' what I am. Oh, _lordy_,\nlordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.\u201d\n\nTom choked off and whispered:\n\n\u201cLook, Hucky, look! He's got his _back_ to us!\u201d\n\nHucky looked, with joy in his heart.\n\n\u201cWell, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you\nknow. _Now_ who can he mean?\u201d\n\nThe howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.\n\n\u201cSh! What's that?\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cSounds like--like hogs grunting. No--it's somebody snoring, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat _is_ it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep\nthere, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts\nthings when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back to\nthis town any more.\u201d\n\nThe spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.\n\n\u201cHucky, do you das't to go if I lead?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!\u201d\n\nTom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the\nboys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their\nheels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,\nthe one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the\nsnorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man\nmoaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was\nMuff Potter. The boys' hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,\nwhen the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,\nthrough the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance\nto exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night\nair again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few\nfeet of where Potter was lying, and _facing_ Potter, with his nose\npointing heavenward.\n\n\u201cOh, geeminy, it's _him_!\u201d exclaimed both boys, in a breath.\n\n\u201cSay, Tom--they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller's\nhouse, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come\nin and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there\nain't anybody dead there yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie Miller fall\nin the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but she ain't _dead_. And what's more, she's getting better, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure as Muff\nPotter's a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they know all about\nthese kind of things, Huck.\u201d\n\nThen they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window\nthe night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and\nfell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He\nwas not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for\nan hour.\n\nWhen Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the\nlight, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not\nbeen called--persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled\nhim with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,\nfeeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had\nfinished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted\neyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill\nto the culprit's heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it\nwas up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into\nsilence and let his heart sink down to the depths.\n\nAfter breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in\nthe hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt\nwept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;\nand finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs\nwith sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.\nThis was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom's heart was sorer now\nthan his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform\nover and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that\nhe had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble\nconfidence.\n\nHe left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward\nSid; and so the latter's prompt retreat through the back gate was\nunnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,\nalong with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the\nair of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to\ntrifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his\ndesk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony\nstare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.\nHis elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time\nhe slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with\na sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal\nsigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!\n\nThis final feather broke the camel's back."
