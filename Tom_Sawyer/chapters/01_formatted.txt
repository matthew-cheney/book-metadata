You TOM!\u201d\n\nNo answer.\n\nThe old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the\nroom; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or\nnever looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were\nher state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for \u201cstyle,\u201d not\nservice--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.\nShe looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but\nstill loud enough for the furniture to hear:\n\n\u201cWell, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--\u201d\n\nShe did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching\nunder the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the\npunches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.\n\n\u201cI never did see the beat of that boy!\u201d\n\nShe went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the\ntomato vines and \u201cjimpson\u201d weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So\nshe lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:\n\n\u201cY-o-u-u TOM!\u201d\n\nThere was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize\na small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.\n\n\u201cThere! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in\nthere?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that\ntruck?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know, aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I know. It's jam--that's what it is. Forty times I've said if you\ndidn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch.\u201d\n\nThe switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--\n\n\u201cMy! Look behind you, aunt!\u201d\n\nThe old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.\nThe lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and\ndisappeared over it.\n\nHis aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle\nlaugh.\n\n\u201cHang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricks\nenough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old\nfools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks,\nas the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,\nand how is a body to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just how long\nhe can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make\nout to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and\nI can't hit him a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's\nthe Lord's truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child,\nas the Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both,\nI know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he's my own\ndead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash him,\nsomehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and\nevery time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is\nborn of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture\nsays, and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this evening, * and [*\nSouthwestern for \u201cafternoon\u201d] I'll just be obleeged to make him work,\ntomorrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays,\nwhen all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he\nhates anything else, and I've _got_ to do some of my duty by him, or\nI'll be the ruination of the child.\u201d\n\nTom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home\nbarely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day's wood\nand split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in time\nto tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.\nTom's younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through\nwith his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,\nand had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.\n\nWhile Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity\noffered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and\nvery deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like\nmany other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she\nwas endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she\nloved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low\ncunning. Said she:\n\n\u201cTom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes'm.\u201d\n\n\u201cPowerful warm, warn't it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes'm.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?\u201d\n\nA bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He\nsearched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing. So he said:\n\n\u201cNo'm--well, not very much.\u201d\n\nThe old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said:\n\n\u201cBut you ain't too warm now, though.\u201d And it flattered her to reflect\nthat she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing\nthat that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew\nwhere the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:\n\n\u201cSome of us pumped on our heads--mine's damp yet. See?\u201d\n\nAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of\ncircumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new\ninspiration:\n\n\u201cTom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to\npump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!\u201d\n\nThe trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His shirt\ncollar was securely sewed.\n\n\u201cBother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey\nand been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a\nsinged cat, as the saying is--better'n you look. _This_ time.\u201d\n\nShe was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom\nhad stumbled into obedient conduct for once.\n\nBut Sidney said:\n\n\u201cWell, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread,\nbut it's black.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I did sew it with white! Tom!\u201d\n\nBut Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:\n\n\u201cSiddy, I'll lick you for that.\u201d\n\nIn a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into\nthe lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle\ncarried white thread and the other black. He said:\n\n\u201cShe'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes\nshe sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to\ngee-miny she'd stick to one or t'other--I can't keep the run of 'em. But\nI bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll learn him!\u201d\n\nHe was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well\nthough--and loathed him.\n\nWithin two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not\nbecause his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a\nman's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore\nthem down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men's\nmisfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new\ninterest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired\nfrom a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It\nconsisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,\nproduced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short\nintervals in the midst of the music--the reader probably remembers how to\ndo it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him\nthe knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of\nharmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer\nfeels who has discovered a new planet--no doubt, as far as strong, deep,\nunalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the\nastronomer.\n\nThe summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom\nchecked his whistle. A stranger was before him--a boy a shade larger\nthan himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive\ncuriosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy\nwas well dressed, too--well dressed on a week-day. This was simply as\nastounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth\nroundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes\non--and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of\nribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The\nmore Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose\nat his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to\nhim to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved--but only\nsidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the\ntime. Finally Tom said:\n\n\u201cI can lick you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI'd like to see you try it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I can do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo you can't, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo you can't.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can't.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan't!\u201d\n\nAn uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:\n\n\u201cWhat's your name?\u201d\n\n\u201c'Tisn't any of your business, maybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I 'low I'll _make_ it my business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell why don't you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you say much, I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch--much--_much_. There now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you think you're mighty smart, _don't_ you? I could lick you with\none hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell why don't you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I _will_, if you fool with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes--I've seen whole families in the same fix.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmarty! You think you're _some_, now, _don't_ you? Oh, what a hat!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to knock it\noff--and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou're a liar!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou're another.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw--take a walk!\u201d\n\n\u201cSay--if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a rock\noff'n your head.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of _course_ you will.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I _will_.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell why don't you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will\nfor? Why don't you _do_ it? It's because you're afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI _ain't_ afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain't.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are.\u201d\n\nAnother pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently\nthey were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:\n\n\u201cGet away from here!\u201d\n\n\u201cGo away yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cI won't.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won't either.\u201d\n\nSo they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both\nshoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But\nneither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and\nflushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:\n\n\u201cYou're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you, and he can\nthrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother that's bigger\nthan he is--and what's more, he can throw him over that fence, too.\u201d\n [Both brothers were imaginary.]\n\n\u201cThat's a lie.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Your_ saying so don't make it so.\u201d\n\nTom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:\n\n\u201cI dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand\nup. Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep.\u201d\n\nThe new boy stepped over promptly, and said:\n\n\u201cNow you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't you crowd me now; you better look out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you _said_ you'd do it--why don't you do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.\u201d\n\nThe new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out\nwith derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys\nwere rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and\nfor the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and\nclothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves\nwith dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the\nfog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him\nwith his fists. \u201cHoller 'nuff!\u201d said he.\n\nThe boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying--mainly from rage.\n\n\u201cHoller 'nuff!\u201d--and the pounding went on.\n\nAt last the stranger got out a smothered \u201c'Nuff!\u201d and Tom let him up and\nsaid:\n\n\u201cNow that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next\ntime.\u201d\n\nThe new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,\nsnuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and\nthreatening what he would do to Tom the \u201cnext time he caught him out.\u201d\n To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and\nas soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it\nand hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like\nan antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he\nlived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the\nenemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the\nwindow and declined. At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom\na bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but\nhe said he \u201c'lowed\u201d to \u201clay\u201d for that boy.\n\nHe got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in\nat the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and\nwhen she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his\nSaturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its\nfirmness."
