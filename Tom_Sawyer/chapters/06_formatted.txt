    "body": "\nMONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found\nhim so--because it began another week's slow suffering in school. He\ngenerally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,\nit made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.\n\nTom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was\nsick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.\nHe canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated\nagain. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he\nbegan to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew\nfeeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly\nhe discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This\nwas lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a \u201cstarter,\u201d as he\ncalled it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that\nargument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought\nhe would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.\nNothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing\nthe doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or\nthree weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly\ndrew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.\nBut now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed\nwell worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable\nspirit.\n\nBut Sid slept on unconscious.\n\nTom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.\n\nNo result from Sid.\n\nTom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then\nswelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.\n\nSid snored on.\n\nTom was aggravated. He said, \u201cSid, Sid!\u201d and shook him. This course\nworked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then\nbrought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.\nTom went on groaning. Sid said:\n\n\u201cTom! Say, Tom!\u201d [No response.] \u201cHere, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,\nTom?\u201d And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.\n\nTom moaned out:\n\n\u201cOh, don't, Sid. Don't joggle me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, what's the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo--never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I must! _Don't_ groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been this\nway?\u201d\n\n\u201cHours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, why didn't you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, _don't!_ It makes my flesh\ncrawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you've ever done to\nme. When I'm gone--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, you ain't dying, are you? Don't, Tom--oh, don't. Maybe--\u201d\n\n\u201cI forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid, you give\nmy window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that's come to\ntown, and tell her--\u201d\n\nBut Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,\nnow, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had\ngathered quite a genuine tone.\n\nSid flew downstairs and said:\n\n\u201cOh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!\u201d\n\n\u201cDying!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes'm. Don't wait--come quick!\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbage! I don't believe it!\u201d\n\nBut she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.\nAnd her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the\nbedside she gasped out:\n\n\u201cYou, Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, auntie, I'm--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!\u201d\n\nThe old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a\nlittle, then did both together. This restored her and she said:\n\n\u201cTom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and\nclimb out of this.\u201d\n\nThe groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a\nlittle foolish, and he said:\n\n\u201cAunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my\ntooth at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.\nWell--your tooth _is_ loose, but you're not going to die about that.\nMary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.\u201d\n\nTom said:\n\n\u201cOh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish\nI may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't want to stay\nhome from school.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you thought you'd\nget to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so,\nand you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your\noutrageousness.\u201d By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old\nlady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom's tooth with a loop\nand tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and\nsuddenly thrust it almost into the boy's face. The tooth hung dangling\nby the bedpost, now.\n\nBut all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after\nbreakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his\nupper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable\nway. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;\nand one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and\nhomage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,\nand shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain\nwhich he did not feel that it wasn't anything to spit like Tom Sawyer;\nbut another boy said, \u201cSour grapes!\u201d and he wandered away a dismantled\nhero.\n\nShortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry\nFinn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and\ndreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless\nand vulgar and bad--and because all their children admired him so, and\ndelighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like\nhim. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied\nHuckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders\nnot to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.\nHuckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown\nmen, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat\nwas a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,\nwhen he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons\nfar down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of\nthe trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged\nin the dirt when not rolled up.\n\nHuckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps\nin fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to\nschool or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could\ngo fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it\nsuited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he\npleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring\nand the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor\nput on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything\nthat goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,\nhampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.\n\nTom hailed the romantic outcast:\n\n\u201cHello, Huckleberry!\u201d\n\n\u201cHello yourself, and see how you like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's that you got?\u201d\n\n\u201cDead cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cLemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get him?\u201d\n\n\u201cBought him off'n a boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you give?\u201d\n\n\u201cI give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere'd you get the blue ticket?\u201d\n\n\u201cBought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay--what is dead cats good for, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood for? Cure warts with.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Is that so? I know something that's better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet you don't. What is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, spunk-water.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpunk-water! I wouldn't give a dern for spunk-water.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wouldn't, wouldn't you? D'you ever try it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I hain't. But Bob Tanner did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you so!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny\ntold Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the\nnigger told me. There now!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what of it? They'll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I\ndon't know _him_. But I never see a nigger that _wouldn't_ lie. Shucks!\nNow you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water\nwas.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the daytime?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith his face to the stump?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Least I reckon so.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he say anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't reckon he did. I don't know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool\nway as that! Why, that ain't a-going to do any good. You got to go all\nby yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there's a\nspunk-water stump, and just as it's midnight you back up against the stump\nand jam your hand in and say:\n\n'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water,\nswaller these warts,'\n\nand then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then\nturn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.\nBecause if you speak the charm's busted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob Tanner\ndone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in this\ntown; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to work\nspunk-water. I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,\nHuck. I play with frogs so much that I've always got considerable many\nwarts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, bean's good. I've done that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you? What's your way?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,\nand then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig\na hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the\nmoon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece\nthat's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to\nfetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the\nwart, and pretty soon off she comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that's it, Huck--that's it; though when you're burying it if you\nsay 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!' it's better.\nThat's the way Joe Harper does, and he's been nearly to Coonville and\nmost everywheres. But say--how do you cure 'em with dead cats?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard 'long about\nmidnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it's\nmidnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can't see\n'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear 'em talk;\nand when they're taking that feller away, you heave your cat after 'em\nand say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I'm\ndone with ye!' That'll fetch _any_ wart.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but old Mother Hopkins told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a witch.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay! Why, Tom, I _know_ she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own\nself. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he\ntook up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her. Well, that\nvery night he rolled off'n a shed wher' he was a layin drunk, and broke\nhis arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, that's awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right\nstiddy, they're a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when\nthey mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer backards.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo-night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday night?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?--and\n_then_ it's Sunday. Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday, I don't\nreckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course--if you ain't afeard.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes--and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep' me\na-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says\n'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his window--but don't you\ntell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but\nI'll meow this time. Say--what's that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing but a tick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere'd you get him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOut in the woods.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat'll you take for him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know. I don't want to sell him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. It's a mighty small tick, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them. I'm\nsatisfied with it. It's a good enough tick for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSho, there's ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of 'em if I wanted\nto.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, why don't you? Becuz you know mighty well you can't. This is a\npretty early tick, I reckon. It's the first one I've seen this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, Huck--I'll give you my tooth for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cLess see it.\u201d\n\nTom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed\nit wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:\n\n\u201cIs it genuwyne?\u201d\n\nTom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.\n\n\u201cWell, all right,\u201d said Huckleberry, \u201cit's a trade.\u201d\n\nTom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the\npinchbug's prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than\nbefore.\n\nWhen Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in\nbriskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He\nhung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like\nalacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom\narm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The\ninterruption roused him.\n\n\u201cThomas Sawyer!\u201d\n\nTom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.\n\n\u201cSir!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?\u201d\n\nTom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of\nyellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric\nsympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the\ngirls' side of the school-house. He instantly said:\n\n\u201c_I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!_\u201d\n\nThe master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of\nstudy ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his\nmind. The master said:\n\n\u201cYou--you did what?\u201d\n\n\u201cStopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.\u201d\n\nThere was no mistaking the words.\n\n\u201cThomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever\nlistened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your\njacket.\u201d\n\nThe master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches\nnotably diminished. Then the order followed:\n\n\u201cNow, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.\u201d\n\nThe titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but\nin reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe\nof his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good\nfortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched\nherself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and\nwhispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the\nlong, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.\n\nBy and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur\nrose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal\nfurtive glances at the girl. She observed it, \u201cmade a mouth\u201d at him\nand gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she\ncautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it\naway. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less\nanimosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it\nremain. Tom scrawled on his slate, \u201cPlease take it--I got more.\u201d The\ngirl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw\nsomething on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time\nthe girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began\nto manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,\napparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt\nto see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she\ngave in and hesitatingly whispered:\n\n\u201cLet me see it.\u201d\n\nTom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends\nto it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl's\ninterest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything\nelse. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:\n\n\u201cIt's nice--make a man.\u201d\n\nThe artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He\ncould have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;\nshe was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:\n\n\u201cIt's a beautiful man--now make me coming along.\u201d\n\nTom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed\nthe spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:\n\n\u201cIt's ever so nice--I wish I could draw.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's easy,\u201d whispered Tom, \u201cI'll learn you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, will you? When?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt noon. Do you go home to dinner?\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll stay if you will.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood--that's a whack. What's your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas Sawyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You call me\nTom, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nNow Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from\nthe girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom\nsaid:\n\n\u201cOh, it ain't anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it ain't. You don't want to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou'll tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I won't--deed and deed and double deed won't.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I won't ever tell _any_body. Now let me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, _you_ don't want to see!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that you treat me so, I _will_ see.\u201d And she put her small hand\nupon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in\nearnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were\nrevealed: \u201c_I love you_.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you bad thing!\u201d And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and\nlooked pleased, nevertheless.\n\nJust at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his\near, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the\nhouse and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles\nfrom the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful\nmoments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But\nalthough Tom's ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.\n\nAs the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but\nthe turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the\nreading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and\nturned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into\ncontinents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and\ngot \u201cturned down,\u201d by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought\nup at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with\nostentation for months."
