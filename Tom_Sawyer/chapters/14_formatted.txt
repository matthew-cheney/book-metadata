    "body": "\nWHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and\nrubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool\ngray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the\ndeep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not\na sound obtruded upon great Nature's meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood\nupon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,\nand a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck\nstill slept.\n\nNow, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently\nthe hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray\nof the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life\nmanifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going\nto work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came\ncrawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air\nfrom time to time and \u201csniffing around,\u201d then proceeding again--for he\nwas measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own\naccord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,\nby turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to\ngo elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its\ncurved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg and\nbegan a journey over him, his whole heart was glad--for that meant that\nhe was going to have a new suit of clothes--without the shadow of a\ndoubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,\nfrom nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled\nmanfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,\nand lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed\nthe dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and\nsaid, \u201cLady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your\nchildren's alone,\u201d and she took wing and went off to see about it--which\ndid not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was\ncredulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity\nmore than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and\nTom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body\nand pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A\ncatbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom's head, and trilled\nout her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then\na shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig\nalmost within the boy's reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the\nstrangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow\nof the \u201cfox\u201d kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to\ninspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never\nseen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.\nAll Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight\npierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few\nbutterflies came fluttering upon the scene.\n\nTom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with\na shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and\ntumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white\nsandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the\ndistance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a\nslight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only\ngratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge\nbetween them and civilization.\n\nThey came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and\nravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a\nspring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak\nor hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood\ncharm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe\nwas slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a\nminute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in\ntheir lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time\nto get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,\na couple of sun-perch and a small catfish--provisions enough for quite a\nfamily. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for\nno fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the\nquicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better\nhe is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,\nopen-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.\n\nThey lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,\nand then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They\ntramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,\namong solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the\nground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came\nupon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.\n\nThey found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be\nastonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles\nlong and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to\nwas only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards\nwide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle\nof the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to\nstop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw\nthemselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,\nand then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,\nand the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.\nThey fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This\ntook dim shape, presently--it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the\nRed-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they\nwere all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak\nhis thought.\n\nFor some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar\nsound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a\nclock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound\nbecame more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,\nglanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There\nwas a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came\nfloating down out of the distance.\n\n\u201cWhat is it!\u201d exclaimed Joe, under his breath.\n\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d said Tom in a whisper.\n\n\u201c'Tain't thunder,\u201d said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, \u201cbecuz thunder--\u201d\n\n\u201cHark!\u201d said Tom. \u201cListen--don't talk.\u201d\n\nThey waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom\ntroubled the solemn hush.\n\n\u201cLet's go and see.\u201d\n\nThey sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They\nparted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little\nsteam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the\ncurrent. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great\nmany skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood\nof the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in\nthem were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the\nferryboat's side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same\ndull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.\n\n\u201cI know now!\u201d exclaimed Tom; \u201csomebody's drownded!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's it!\u201d said Huck; \u201cthey done that last summer, when Bill Turner\ngot drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes\nhim come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put\nquicksilver in 'em and set 'em afloat, and wherever there's anybody\nthat's drownded, they'll float right there and stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I've heard about that,\u201d said Joe. \u201cI wonder what makes the bread\ndo that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it ain't the bread, so much,\u201d said Tom; \u201cI reckon it's mostly what\nthey _say_ over it before they start it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they don't say anything over it,\u201d said Huck. \u201cI've seen 'em and\nthey don't.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that's funny,\u201d said Tom. \u201cBut maybe they say it to themselves. Of\n_course_ they do. Anybody might know that.\u201d\n\nThe other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because\nan ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not\nbe expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such\ngravity.\n\n\u201cBy jings, I wish I was over there, now,\u201d said Joe.\n\n\u201cI do too\u201d said Huck \u201cI'd give heaps to know who it is.\u201d\n\nThe boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought\nflashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:\n\n\u201cBoys, I know who's drownded--it's us!\u201d\n\nThey felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they\nwere missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;\ntears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor\nlost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being\nindulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,\nand the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was\nconcerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.\n\nAs twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business\nand the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were\njubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble\nthey were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then\nfell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;\nand the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were\ngratifying to look upon--from their point of view. But when the shadows\nof night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing\ninto the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The\nexcitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts\nof certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as\nmuch as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a\nsigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a\nroundabout \u201cfeeler\u201d as to how the others might look upon a return to\ncivilization--not right now, but--\n\nTom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined\nin with Tom, and the waverer quickly \u201cexplained,\u201d and was glad to get\nout of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness\nclinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to\nrest for the moment.\n\nAs the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.\nJoe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,\nwatching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,\nand went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung\nby the campfire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders\nof the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed\nto suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something\nupon each of these with his \u201cred keel\u201d; one he rolled up and put in his\njacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe's hat and removed it to a\nlittle distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain\nschoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value--among them a lump of\nchalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind\nof marbles known as a \u201csure 'nough crystal.\u201d Then he tiptoed his way\ncautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and\nstraightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar."
