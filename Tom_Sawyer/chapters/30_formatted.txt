    "body": "\nAS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came\ngroping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman's door. The\ninmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,\non account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a\nwindow:\n\n\u201cWho's there!\u201d\n\nHuck's scared voice answered in a low tone:\n\n\u201cPlease let me in! It's only Huck Finn!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's a name that can open this door night or day, lad!--and welcome!\u201d\n\nThese were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the pleasantest\nhe had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever\nbeen applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he\nentered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall\nsons speedily dressed themselves.\n\n\u201cNow, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be\nready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too--make\nyourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and stop\nhere last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was awful scared,\u201d said Huck, \u201cand I run. I took out when the pistols\nwent off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz I wanted\nto know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn't\nwant to run across them devils, even if they was dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it--but\nthere's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast. No, they\nain't dead, lad--we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right\nwhere to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along\non tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them--dark as a cellar that\nsumach path was--and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the\nmeanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use--'twas bound to\ncome, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when\nthe sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,\nI sung out, 'Fire boys!' and blazed away at the place where the rustling\nwas. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and\nwe after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them.\nThey fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by\nand didn't do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet\nwe quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a\nposse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it\nis light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys\nwill be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of\nthose rascals--'twould help a good deal. But you couldn't see what they\nwere like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSplendid! Describe them--describe them, my boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cOne's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or\ntwice, and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged--\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back\nof the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and\ntell the sheriff--get your breakfast tomorrow morning!\u201d\n\nThe Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck\nsprang up and exclaimed:\n\n\u201cOh, please don't tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them! Oh,\nplease!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what\nyou did.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, no! Please don't tell!\u201d\n\nWhen the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:\n\n\u201cThey won't tell--and I won't. But why don't you want it known?\u201d\n\nHuck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too\nmuch about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew\nanything against him for the whole world--he would be killed for knowing\nit, sure.\n\nThe old man promised secrecy once more, and said:\n\n\u201cHow did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking\nsuspicious?\u201d\n\nHuck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:\n\n\u201cWell, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot,--least everybody says so, and\nI don't see nothing agin it--and sometimes I can't sleep much, on account\nof thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of\ndoing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I\ncome along upstreet 'bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I\ngot to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed\nup agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes\nthese two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their\narm, and I reckoned they'd stole it. One was a-smoking, and t'other one\nwanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up\ntheir faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,\nby his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t'other one was a\nrusty, ragged-looking devil.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould you see the rags by the light of the cigars?\u201d\n\nThis staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:\n\n\u201cWell, I don't know--but somehow it seems as if I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen they went on, and you--\u201d\n\n\u201cFollered 'em--yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up--they sneaked\nalong so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and stood in the dark and\nheard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he'd\nspile her looks just as I told you and your two--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! The _deaf and dumb_ man said all that!\u201d\n\nHuck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep\nthe old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,\nand yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of\nall he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape,\nbut the old man's eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.\nPresently the Welshman said:\n\n\u201cMy boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for\nall the world. No--I'd protect you--I'd protect you. This Spaniard is\nnot deaf and dumb; you've let that slip without intending it; you can't\ncover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want\nto keep dark. Now trust me--tell me what it is, and trust me--I won't\nbetray you.\u201d\n\nHuck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent over and\nwhispered in his ear:\n\n\u201c'Tain't a Spaniard--it's Injun Joe!\u201d\n\nThe Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:\n\n\u201cIt's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and\nslitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because\nwhite men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a\ndifferent matter altogether.\u201d\n\nDuring breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man\nsaid that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going\nto bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for\nmarks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of--\n\n\u201cOf _what_?\u201d\n\nIf the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more\nstunning suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were staring\nwide, now, and his breath suspended--waiting for the answer. The Welshman\nstarted--stared in return--three seconds--five seconds--ten--then replied:\n\n\u201cOf burglar's tools. Why, what's the _matter_ with you?\u201d\n\nHuck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The\nWelshman eyed him gravely, curiously--and presently said:\n\n\u201cYes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what\ndid give you that turn? What were _you_ expecting we'd found?\u201d\n\nHuck was in a close place--the inquiring eye was upon him--he would have\ngiven anything for material for a plausible answer--nothing suggested\nitself--the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper--a senseless\nreply offered--there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered\nit--feebly:\n\n\u201cSunday-school books, maybe.\u201d\n\nPoor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and\njoyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and\nended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man's pocket, because\nit cut down the doctor's bill like everything. Then he added:\n\n\u201cPoor old chap, you're white and jaded--you ain't well a bit--no wonder\nyou're a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll come out of it.\nRest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.\u201d\n\nHuck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such\na suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel\nbrought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the\ntalk at the widow's stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,\nhowever--he had not known that it wasn't--and so the suggestion of a\ncaptured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole\nhe felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all\nquestion that that bundle was not _the_ bundle, and so his mind was\nat rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be\ndrifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still\nin No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and\nTom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of\ninterruption.\n\nJust as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck\njumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even\nremotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and\ngentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of\ncitizens were climbing up the hill--to stare at the stile. So the news\nhad spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the\nvisitors. The widow's gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.\n\n\u201cDon't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're more\nbeholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don't allow me\nto tell his name. We wouldn't have been there but for him.\u201d\n\nOf course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the\nmain matter--but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his\nvisitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he\nrefused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the\nwidow said:\n\n\u201cI went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that\nnoise. Why didn't you come and wake me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to come\nagain--they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use of\nwaking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard\nat your house all the rest of the night. They've just come back.\u201d\n\nMore visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple\nof hours more.\n\nThere was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody\nwas early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came\nthat not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the\nsermon was finished, Judge Thatcher's wife dropped alongside of Mrs.\nHarper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:\n\n\u201cIs my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired\nto death.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Becky?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d with a startled look--\u201cdidn't she stay with you last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, no.\u201d\n\nMrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,\ntalking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:\n\n\u201cGoodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy\nthat's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last\nnight--one of you. And now he's afraid to come to church. I've got to\nsettle with him.\u201d\n\nMrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.\n\n\u201cHe didn't stay with us,\u201d said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A\nmarked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.\n\n\u201cJoe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo'm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did you see him last?\u201d\n\nJoe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had\nstopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding\nuneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously\nquestioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed\nwhether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;\nit was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One\nyoung man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!\nMrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her\nhands.\n\nThe alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to\nstreet, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and\nthe whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant\ninsignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs\nwere manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half\nan hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward\nthe cave.\n\nAll the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women\nvisited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They\ncried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the\ntedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at\nlast, all the word that came was, \u201cSend more candles--and send food.\u201d\n Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher\nsent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed\nno real cheer.\n\nThe old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with\ncandle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck\nstill in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with\nfever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came\nand took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,\nbecause, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord's,\nand nothing that was the Lord's was a thing to be neglected. The\nWelshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:\n\n\u201cYou can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it off.\nHe never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his\nhands.\u201d\n\nEarly in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the\nvillage, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the\nnews that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being\nransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and\ncrevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered\nthrough the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither\nand thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their\nhollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place,\nfar from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names \u201cBECKY &\nTOM\u201d had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and\nnear at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the\nribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever\nhave of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so\nprecious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the\nawful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away\nspeck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst\nforth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle--and then a\nsickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there;\nit was only a searcher's light.\n\nThree dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and\nthe village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.\nThe accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the\nTemperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the\npublic pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck\nfeebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked--dimly\ndreading the worst--if anything had been discovered at the Temperance\nTavern since he had been ill.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the widow.\n\nHuck started up in bed, wildeyed:\n\n\u201cWhat? What was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cLiquor!--and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child--what a turn you\ndid give me!\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly tell me just one thing--only just one--please! Was it Tom Sawyer\nthat found it?\u201d\n\nThe widow burst into tears. \u201cHush, hush, child, hush! I've told you\nbefore, you must _not_ talk. You are very, very sick!\u201d\n\nThen nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great\npowwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever--gone\nforever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should\ncry.\n\nThese thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the\nweariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:\n\n\u201cThere--he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody\ncould find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now, that's got hope\nenough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.\u201d"
