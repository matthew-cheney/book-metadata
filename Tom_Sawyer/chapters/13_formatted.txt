    "body": "\nTOM'S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a\nforsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out\nwhat they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried\nto do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing\nwould do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame\n_him_ for the consequences--why shouldn't they? What right had the\nfriendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would\nlead a life of crime. There was no choice.\n\nBy this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to\n\u201ctake up\u201d tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he\nshould never, never hear that old familiar sound any more--it was very\nhard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold\nworld, he must submit--but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and\nfast.\n\nJust at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe\nHarper--hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his\nheart. Plainly here were \u201ctwo souls with but a single thought.\u201d Tom,\nwiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about\na resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by\nroaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping\nthat Joe would not forget him.\n\nBut it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going\nto make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother\nhad whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and\nknew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished\nhim to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but\nsuccumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her\npoor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.\n\nAs the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand\nby each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved\nthem of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for\nbeing a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying,\nsome time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he\nconceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of\ncrime, and so he consented to be a pirate.\n\nThree miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River\nwas a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,\nwith a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a\nrendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further\nshore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson's\nIsland was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a\nmatter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,\nand he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was\nindifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the\nriver-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour--which was\nmidnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.\nEach would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal\nin the most dark and mysterious way--as became outlaws. And before the\nafternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of\nspreading the fact that pretty soon the town would \u201chear something.\u201d All\nwho got this vague hint were cautioned to \u201cbe mum and wait.\u201d\n\nAbout midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,\nand stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the\nmeeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay\nlike an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the\nquiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under\nthe bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the\nsame way. Then a guarded voice said:\n\n\u201cWho goes there?\u201d\n\n\u201cTom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.\u201d Tom\nhad furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.\n\n\u201c'Tis well. Give the countersign.\u201d\n\nTwo hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the\nbrooding night:\n\n\u201c_Blood_!\u201d\n\nThen Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,\ntearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was\nan easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked\nthe advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.\n\nThe Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn\nhimself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a\nskillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought\na few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or\n\u201cchewed\u201d but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it\nwould never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;\nmatches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering\nupon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily\nthither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing\nadventure of it, saying, \u201cHist!\u201d every now and then, and suddenly\nhalting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;\nand giving orders in dismal whispers that if \u201cthe foe\u201d stirred, to \u201clet\nhim have it to the hilt,\u201d because \u201cdead men tell no tales.\u201d They knew\nwell enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying\nin stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their\nconducting this thing in an unpiratical way.\n\nThey shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and\nJoe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded\narms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:\n\n\u201cLuff, and bring her to the wind!\u201d\n\n\u201cAye-aye, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cSteady, steady-y-y-y!\u201d\n\n\u201cSteady it is, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet her go off a point!\u201d\n\n\u201cPoint it is, sir!\u201d\n\nAs the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream\nit was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for\n\u201cstyle,\u201d and were not intended to mean anything in particular.\n\n\u201cWhat sail's she carrying?\u201d\n\n\u201cCourses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend the r'yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of\nye--foretopmaststuns'l! Lively, now!\u201d\n\n\u201cAye-aye, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cShake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! _now_ my hearties!\u201d\n\n\u201cAye-aye, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cHellum-a-lee--hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,\nport! _Now_, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!\u201d\n\n\u201cSteady it is, sir!\u201d\n\nThe raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head\nright, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was\nnot more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during\nthe next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before\nthe distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,\npeacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,\nunconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black\nAvenger stood still with folded arms, \u201clooking his last\u201d upon the scene\nof his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing \u201cshe\u201d could see\nhim now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless\nheart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but\na small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson's Island beyond\neye-shot of the village, and so he \u201clooked his last\u201d with a broken and\nsatisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and\nthey all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift\nthem out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in\ntime, and made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in the morning the\nraft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,\nand they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part\nof the little raft's belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they\nspread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;\nbut they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as\nbecame outlaws.\n\nThey built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps\nwithin the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in\nthe frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn \u201cpone\u201d stock\nthey had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,\nfree way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,\nfar from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to\ncivilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy\nglare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the\nvarnished foliage and festooning vines.\n\nWhen the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance\nof corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,\nfilled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but\nthey would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting\ncampfire.\n\n\u201c_Ain't_ it gay?\u201d said Joe.\n\n\u201cIt's _nuts_!\u201d said Tom. \u201cWhat would the boys say if they could see us?\u201d\n\n\u201cSay? Well, they'd just die to be here--hey, Hucky!\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon so,\u201d said Huckleberry; \u201canyways, I'm suited. I don't want\nnothing better'n this. I don't ever get enough to eat, gen'ally--and here\nthey can't come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's just the life for me,\u201d said Tom. \u201cYou don't have to get up,\nmornings, and you don't have to go to school, and wash, and all that\nblame foolishness. You see a pirate don't have to do _anything_, Joe,\nwhen he's ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and\nthen he don't have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, that's so,\u201d said Joe, \u201cbut I hadn't thought much about it, you\nknow. I'd a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I've tried it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Tom, \u201cpeople don't go much on hermits, nowadays, like\nthey used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected. And\na hermit's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put\nsackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?\u201d inquired Huck.\n\n\u201cI dono. But they've _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You'd have to do\nthat if you was a hermit.\u201d\n\n\u201cDern'd if I would,\u201d said Huck.\n\n\u201cWell, what would you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dono. But I wouldn't do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Huck, you'd _have_ to. How'd you get around it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I just wouldn't stand it. I'd run away.\u201d\n\n\u201cRun away! Well, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You'd be\na disgrace.\u201d\n\nThe Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished\ngouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with\ntobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of\nfragrant smoke--he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The\nother pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to\nacquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:\n\n\u201cWhat does pirates have to do?\u201d\n\nTom said:\n\n\u201cOh, they have just a bully time--take ships and burn them, and get the\nmoney and bury it in awful places in their island where there's ghosts\nand things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships--make 'em walk a\nplank.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they carry the women to the island,\u201d said Joe; \u201cthey don't kill the\nwomen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d assented Tom, \u201cthey don't kill the women--they're too noble. And\nthe women's always beautiful, too.\n\n\u201cAnd don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver\nand di'monds,\u201d said Joe, with enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d said Huck.\n\n\u201cWhy, the pirates.\u201d\n\nHuck scanned his own clothing forlornly.\n\n\u201cI reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate,\u201d said he, with a\nregretful pathos in his voice; \u201cbut I ain't got none but these.\u201d\n\nBut the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,\nafter they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand\nthat his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for\nwealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.\n\nGradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the\neyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the\nRed-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.\nThe Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had\nmore difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,\nand lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them\nkneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at\nall, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they\nmight call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at\nonce they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep--but an\nintruder came, now, that would not \u201cdown.\u201d It was conscience. They began\nto feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and\nnext they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.\nThey tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had\npurloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not\nto be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the\nend, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking\nsweetmeats was only \u201chooking,\u201d while taking bacon and hams and such\nvaluables was plain simple stealing--and there was a command against that\nin the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in\nthe business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the\ncrime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously\ninconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep."
