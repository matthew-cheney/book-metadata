    "body": "\nNOW to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic. They tripped along\nthe murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar\nwonders of the cave--wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names,\nsuch as \u201cThe Drawing-Room,\u201d \u201cThe Cathedral,\u201d \u201cAladdin's Palace,\u201d and\nso on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky\nengaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle\nwearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their\ncandles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates,\npostoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been\nfrescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they\nscarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls\nwere not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging\nshelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream\nof water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with\nit, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara\nin gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind\nit in order to illuminate it for Becky's gratification. He found that\nit curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between\nnarrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.\n\nBecky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future\nguidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,\nfar down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and\nbranched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In\none place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a\nmultitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of\na man's leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and\npresently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into\nit. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was\nincrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst\nof a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which\nhad been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites\ntogether, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the\nroof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a\nbunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by\nhundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their\nways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky's hand and\nhurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for\na bat struck Becky's light out with its wing while she was passing out\nof the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the\nfugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got\nrid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,\nwhich stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the\nshadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would\nbe best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the\ndeep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the\nchildren. Becky said:\n\n\u201cWhy, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of\nthe others.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome to think, Becky, we are away down below them--and I don't know how\nfar away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn't hear\nthem here.\u201d\n\nBecky grew apprehensive.\n\n\u201cI wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon I could find it--but then the bats. If they put our candles\nout it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so as not to go\nthrough there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!\u201d and the girl\nshuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.\n\nThey started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long\nway, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar\nabout the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an\nexamination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he\nwould say cheerily:\n\n\u201cOh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right\naway!\u201d\n\nBut he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began\nto turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of\nfinding the one that was wanted. He still said it was \u201call right,\u201d but\nthere was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their\nring and sounded just as if he had said, \u201cAll is lost!\u201d Becky clung to\nhis side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,\nbut they would come. At last she said:\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem to get\nworse and worse off all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d said he.\n\nProfound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were\nconspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down\nthe empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that\nresembled a ripple of mocking laughter.\n\n\u201cOh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,\u201d said Becky.\n\n\u201cIt is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,\u201d and\nhe shouted again.\n\nThe \u201cmight\u201d was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so\nconfessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but\nthere was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried\nhis steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his\nmanner revealed another fearful fact to Becky--he could not find his way\nback!\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!\u201d\n\n\u201cBecky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to\ncome back! No--I can't find the way. It's all mixed up.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this awful\nplace! Oh, why _did_ we ever leave the others!\u201d\n\nShe sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom\nwas appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He\nsat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in\nhis bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing\nregrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom\nbegged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell\nto blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable\nsituation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope\nagain, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he\nwould not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,\nshe said.\n\nSo they moved on again--aimlessly--simply at random--all they could do\nwas to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of\nreviving--not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its\nnature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and\nfamiliarity with failure.\n\nBy-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy meant so\nmuch! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again.\nShe knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his\npockets--yet he must economize.\n\nBy-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay\nattention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was\ngrown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction,\nwas at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to\ninvite death and shorten its pursuit.\n\nAt last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.\nTom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there,\nand the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom\ntried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements\nwere grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore\nso heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful.\nHe sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural\nunder the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and\nrested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing\ninto his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and\ndreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a\nbreezy little laugh--but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan\nfollowed it.\n\n\u201cOh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I\ndon't, Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find\nthe way out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I\nreckon we are going there.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying.\u201d\n\nThey rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried\nto estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was\nthat it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not\nbe, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this--they\ncould not tell how long--Tom said they must go softly and listen for\ndripping water--they must find a spring. They found one presently, and\nTom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky\nsaid she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to\nhear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom\nfastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought\nwas soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the\nsilence:\n\n\u201cTom, I am so hungry!\u201d\n\nTom took something out of his pocket.\n\n\u201cDo you remember this?\u201d said he.\n\nBecky almost smiled.\n\n\u201cIt's our wedding-cake, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes--I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've got.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup\npeople do with wedding-cake--but it'll be our--\u201d\n\nShe dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky\nate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was\nabundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky\nsuggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he\nsaid:\n\n\u201cBecky, can you bear it if I tell you something?\u201d\n\nBecky's face paled, but she thought she could.\n\n\u201cWell, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink.\nThat little piece is our last candle!\u201d\n\nBecky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort\nher, but with little effect. At length Becky said:\n\n\u201cTom!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Becky?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey'll miss us and hunt for us!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they will! Certainly they will!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they're hunting for us now, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen would they miss us, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they get back to the boat, I reckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, it might be dark then--would they notice we hadn't come?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they\ngot home.\u201d\n\nA frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and he saw\nthat he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!\nThe children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of\ngrief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers\nalso--that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher\ndiscovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper's.\n\nThe children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it\nmelt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone\nat last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of\nsmoke, linger at its top a moment, and then--the horror of utter darkness\nreigned!\n\nHow long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that\nshe was crying in Tom's arms, neither could tell. All that they knew\nwas, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of\na dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said\nit might be Sunday, now--maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but\nher sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that\nthey must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going\non. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in\nthe darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no\nmore.\n\nThe hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A\nportion of Tom's half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But\nthey seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted\ndesire.\n\nBy-and-by Tom said:\n\n\u201cSH! Did you hear that?\u201d\n\nBoth held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the\nfaintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by\nthe hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently\nhe listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little\nnearer.\n\n\u201cIt's them!\u201d said Tom; \u201cthey're coming! Come along, Becky--we're all\nright now!\u201d\n\nThe joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,\nhowever, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded\nagainst. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three\nfeet deep, it might be a hundred--there was no passing it at any rate.\nTom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No\nbottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They\nlistened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant!\na moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking\nmisery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He\ntalked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no\nsounds came again.\n\nThe children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged\non; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed\nit must be Tuesday by this time.\n\nNow an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It\nwould be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the\nheavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to\na projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the\nline as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended\nin a \u201cjumping-off place.\u201d Tom got down on his knees and felt below,\nand then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands\nconveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the\nright, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding\na candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,\nand instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to--Injun\nJoe's! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the\nnext moment, to see the \u201cSpaniard\u201d take to his heels and get himself out\nof sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come\nover and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have\ndisguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom's\nfright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he\nhad strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and\nnothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He\nwas careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he\nhad only shouted \u201cfor luck.\u201d\n\nBut hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.\nAnother tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought\nchanges. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed\nthat it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,\nand that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another\npassage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But\nBecky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be\nroused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die--it would\nnot be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he\nchose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak\nto her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would\nstay by her and hold her hand until all was over.\n\nTom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show\nof being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave;\nthen he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the\npassages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with\nbodings of coming doom."
