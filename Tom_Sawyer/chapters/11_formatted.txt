    "body": "\nCLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified\nwith the ghastly news. No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph;\nthe tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,\nwith little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave\nholi-day for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of\nhim if he had not.\n\nA gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been\nrecognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter--so the story ran. And\nit was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself\nin the \u201cbranch\u201d about one or two o'clock in the morning, and that Potter\nhad at once sneaked off--suspicious circumstances, especially the washing\nwhich was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had\nbeen ransacked for this \u201cmurderer\u201d (the public are not slow in the\nmatter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he\ncould not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every\ndirection, and the Sheriff \u201cwas confident\u201d that he would be captured\nbefore night.\n\nAll the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom's heartbreak\nvanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not\na thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,\nunaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he\nwormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.\nIt seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched\nhis arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry's. Then both looked\nelsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their\nmutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly\nspectacle before them.\n\n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d \u201cPoor young fellow!\u201d \u201cThis ought to be a lesson to grave\nrobbers!\u201d \u201cMuff Potter'll hang for this if they catch him!\u201d This was the\ndrift of remark; and the minister said, \u201cIt was a judgment; His hand is\nhere.\u201d\n\nNow Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid\nface of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,\nand voices shouted, \u201cIt's him! it's him! he's coming himself!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho? Who?\u201d from twenty voices.\n\n\u201cMuff Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cHallo, he's stopped!--Look out, he's turning! Don't let him get away!\u201d\n\nPeople in the branches of the trees over Tom's head said he wasn't\ntrying to get away--he only looked doubtful and perplexed.\n\n\u201cInfernal impudence!\u201d said a bystander; \u201cwanted to come and take a quiet\nlook at his work, I reckon--didn't expect any company.\u201d\n\nThe crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously\nleading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow's face was haggard, and\nhis eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the\nmurdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands\nand burst into tears.\n\n\u201cI didn't do it, friends,\u201d he sobbed; \u201c'pon my word and honor I never\ndone it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho's accused you?\u201d shouted a voice.\n\nThis shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around\nhim with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and\nexclaimed:\n\n\u201cOh, Injun Joe, you promised me you'd never--\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that your knife?\u201d and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.\n\nPotter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the\nground. Then he said:\n\n\u201cSomething told me 't if I didn't come back and get--\u201d He shuddered; then\nwaved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, \u201cTell 'em,\nJoe, tell 'em--it ain't any use any more.\u201d\n\nThen Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the\nstony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every\nmoment that the clear sky would deliver God's lightnings upon his head,\nand wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had\nfinished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to\nbreak their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner's life faded and\nvanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and\nit would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.\n\n\u201cWhy didn't you leave? What did you want to come here for?\u201d somebody\nsaid.\n\n\u201cI couldn't help it--I couldn't help it,\u201d Potter moaned. \u201cI wanted to\nrun away, but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but here.\u201d And he fell to\nsobbing again.\n\nInjun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes\nafterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the\nlightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that\nJoe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most\nbalefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could\nnot take their fascinated eyes from his face.\n\nThey inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should\noffer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.\n\nInjun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in\na wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering\ncrowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy\ncircumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were\ndisappointed, for more than one villager remarked:\n\n\u201cIt was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.\u201d\n\nTom's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as\nmuch as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:\n\n\u201cTom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me\nawake half the time.\u201d\n\nTom blanched and dropped his eyes.\n\n\u201cIt's a bad sign,\u201d said Aunt Polly, gravely. \u201cWhat you got on your mind,\nTom?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing. Nothing 't I know of.\u201d But the boy's hand shook so that he\nspilled his coffee.\n\n\u201cAnd you do talk such stuff,\u201d Sid said. \u201cLast night you said, 'It's\nblood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and over.\nAnd you said, 'Don't torment me so--I'll tell!' Tell _what_? What is it\nyou'll tell?\u201d\n\nEverything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have\nhappened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly's face\nand she came to Tom's relief without knowing it. She said:\n\n\u201cSho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night\nmyself. Sometimes I dream it's me that done it.\u201d\n\nMary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.\nTom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after\nthat he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every\nnight. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently\nslipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good\nwhile at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place\nagain. Tom's distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew\nirksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of\nTom's disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.\n\nIt seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding\ninquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.\nSid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,\nthough it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;\nhe noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness--and that was strange;\nand Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion\nto these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,\nbut said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and\nceased to torture Tom's conscience.\n\nEvery day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his\nopportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such\nsmall comforts through to the \u201cmurderer\u201d as he could get hold of. The\njail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge\nof the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it\nwas seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom's\nconscience.\n\nThe villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride\nhim on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character\nthat nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the\nmatter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his\ninquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery\nthat preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in\nthe courts at present."
