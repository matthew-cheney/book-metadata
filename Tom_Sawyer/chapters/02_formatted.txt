    "body": "\nSATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and\nfresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if\nthe heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in\nevery face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom\nand the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond\nthe village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far\nenough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.\n\nTom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a\nlong-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and\na deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board\nfence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a\nburden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost\nplank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant\nwhitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed\nfence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at\nthe gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from\nthe town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but\nnow it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at\nthe pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there\nwaiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,\nskylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred\nand fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an\nhour--and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:\n\n\u201cSay, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some.\u201d\n\nJim shook his head and said:\n\n\u201cCan't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis water\nan' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. She say she spec' Mars Tom gwine\nto ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long an' 'tend to my own\nbusiness--she 'lowed _she'd_ 'tend to de whitewashin'.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That's the way she always talks.\nGimme the bucket--I won't be gone only a a minute. _She_ won't ever\nknow.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I dasn't, Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head off'n me.\n'Deed she would.\u201d\n\n\u201c_She_! She never licks anybody--whacks 'em over the head with her\nthimble--and who cares for that, I'd like to know. She talks awful, but\ntalk don't hurt--anyways it don't if she don't cry. Jim, I'll give you a\nmarvel. I'll give you a white alley!\u201d\n\nJim began to waver.\n\n\u201cWhite alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I's powerful\n'fraid ole missis--\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe.\u201d\n\nJim was only human--this attraction was too much for him. He put down\nhis pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing\ninterest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he\nwas flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was\nwhitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with\na slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.\n\nBut Tom's energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had\nplanned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys\nwould come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and\nthey would make a world of fun of him for having to work--the very\nthought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and\nexamined it--bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange\nof _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour\nof pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and\ngave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless\nmoment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,\nmagnificent inspiration.\n\nHe took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in\nsight presently--the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been\ndreading. Ben's gait was the hop-skip-and-jump--proof enough that his\nheart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and\ngiving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned\nding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As\nhe drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned\nfar over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp\nand circumstance--for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered\nhimself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and\nengine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own\nhurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:\n\n\u201cStop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!\u201d The headway ran almost out, and he\ndrew up slowly toward the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cShip up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!\u201d His arms straightened and stiffened\ndown his sides.\n\n\u201cSet her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!\nChow!\u201d His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles--for it was\nrepresenting a forty-foot wheel.\n\n\u201cLet her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!\u201d\n The left hand began to describe circles.\n\n\u201cStop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on\nthe stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling!\nChow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _lively_ now! Come--out with\nyour spring-line--what're you about there! Take a turn round that stump\nwith the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now--let her go! Done with\nthe engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH'T! S'H'T! SH'T!\u201d (trying the\ngauge-cocks).\n\nTom went on whitewashing--paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared\na moment and then said: \u201c_Hi-Yi! You're_ up a stump, ain't you!\u201d\n\nNo answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then\nhe gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as\nbefore. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom's mouth watered for the\napple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:\n\n\u201cHello, old chap, you got to work, hey?\u201d\n\nTom wheeled suddenly and said:\n\n\u201cWhy, it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay--I'm going in a-swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of\ncourse you'd druther _work_--wouldn't you? Course you would!\u201d\n\nTom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:\n\n\u201cWhat do you call work?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, ain't _that_ work?\u201d\n\nTom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:\n\n\u201cWell, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it suits Tom\nSawyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you _like_ it?\u201d\n\nThe brush continued to move.\n\n\u201cLike it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get a\nchance to whitewash a fence every day?\u201d\n\nThat put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.\nTom swept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the\neffect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again--Ben\nwatching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more\nabsorbed. Presently he said:\n\n\u201cSay, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.\u201d\n\nTom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:\n\n\u201cNo--no--I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's awful\nparticular about this fence--right here on the street, you know--but if it\nwas the back fence I wouldn't mind and _she_ wouldn't. Yes, she's awful\nparticular about this fence; it's got to be done very careful; I reckon\nthere ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it\nthe way it's got to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo--is that so? Oh come, now--lemme just try. Only just a little--I'd let\n_you_, if you was me, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cBen, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly--well, Jim wanted to do\nit, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn't let\nSid. Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If you was to tackle this fence\nand anything was to happen to it--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say--I'll give you\nthe core of my apple.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, here--No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard--\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll give you _all_ of it!\u201d\n\nTom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his\nheart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the\nsun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,\ndangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more\ninnocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every\nlittle while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time\nBen was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for\na kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in\nfor a dead rat and a string to swing it with--and so on, and so on, hour\nafter hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a\npoor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in\nwealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part\nof a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool\ncannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a\nglass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,\nsix fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a\ndog-collar--but no dog--the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,\nand a dilapidated old window sash.\n\nHe had had a nice, good, idle time all the while--plenty of company--and\nthe fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn't run out of\nwhitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.\n\nTom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He\nhad discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it--namely,\nthat in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary\nto make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and\nwise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have\ncomprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do,\nand that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And\nthis would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or\nperforming on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing\nMont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England\nwho drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a\ndaily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable\nmoney; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn\nit into work and then they would resign.\n\nThe boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place\nin his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to\nreport."
