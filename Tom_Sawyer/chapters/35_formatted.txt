    "body": "\nTHE reader may rest satisfied that Tom's and Huck's windfall made a\nmighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a\nsum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked\nabout, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens\ntottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every \u201chaunted\u201d\n house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,\nplank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden\ntreasure--and not by boys, but men--pretty grave, unromantic men, too,\nsome of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired,\nstared at. The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had\npossessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and\nrepeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as\nremarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying\ncommonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and\ndiscovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper\npublished biographical sketches of the boys.\n\nThe Widow Douglas put Huck's money out at six per cent., and Judge\nThatcher did the same with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request. Each lad had\nan income, now, that was simply prodigious--a dollar for every weekday in\nthe year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got--no,\nit was what he was promised--he generally couldn't collect it. A dollar\nand a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old\nsimple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.\n\nJudge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no\ncommonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When\nBecky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her\nwhipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded\ngrace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that\nwhipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine\noutburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie--a lie that\nwas worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to\nbreast with George Washington's lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky\nthought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he\nwalked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight\noff and told Tom about it.\n\nJudge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some\nday. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the\nNational Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school\nin the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or\nboth.\n\nHuck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas'\nprotection introduced him into society--no, dragged him into it, hurled\nhim into it--and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The\nwidow's servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they\nbedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot\nor stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had\nto eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate;\nhe had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so\nproperly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he\nturned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him\nhand and foot.\n\nHe bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up\nmissing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in\ngreat distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high\nand low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning\nTom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind\nthe abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.\nHuck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and\nends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was\nunkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made\nhim picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him\nout, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.\nHuck's face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He\nsaid:\n\n\u201cDon't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it don't\nwork, Tom. It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The widder's good to me,\nand friendly; but I can't stand them ways. She makes me get up just\nat the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all\nto thunder; she won't let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them\nblamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don't seem to any air\ngit through 'em, somehow; and they're so rotten nice that I can't\nset down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher's; I hain't slid on a\ncellar-door for--well, it 'pears to be years; I got to go to church\nand sweat and sweat--I hate them ornery sermons! I can't ketch a fly in\nthere, I can't chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by\na bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell--everything's so\nawful reg'lar a body can't stand it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, everybody does that way, Huck.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, it don't make no difference. I ain't everybody, and I can't\n_stand_ it. It's awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy--I don't\ntake no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing;\nI got to ask to go in a-swimming--dern'd if I hain't got to ask to do\neverything. Well, I'd got to talk so nice it wasn't no comfort--I'd got\nto go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste\nin my mouth, or I'd a died, Tom. The widder wouldn't let me smoke;\nshe wouldn't let me yell, she wouldn't let me gape, nor stretch, nor\nscratch, before folks--\u201d [Then with a spasm of special irritation and\ninjury]--\u201cAnd dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a\nwoman! I _had_ to shove, Tom--I just had to. And besides, that school's\ngoing to open, and I'd a had to go to it--well, I wouldn't stand _that_,\nTom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain't what it's cracked up to be. It's\njust worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead\nall the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar'l suits me, and\nI ain't ever going to shake 'em any more. Tom, I wouldn't ever got into\nall this trouble if it hadn't 'a' ben for that money; now you just take\nmy sheer of it along with your'n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes--not\nmany times, becuz I don't give a dern for a thing 'thout it's tollable\nhard to git--and you go and beg off for me with the widder.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides if you'll\ntry this thing just a while longer you'll come to like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike it! Yes--the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to set on it long\nenough. No, Tom, I won't be rich, and I won't live in them cussed\nsmothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and\nI'll stick to 'em, too. Blame it all! just as we'd got guns, and a cave,\nand all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up\nand spile it all!\u201d\n\nTom saw his opportunity--\n\n\u201cLookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from turning\nrobber.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as dead earnest as I'm sitting here. But Huck, we can't let you\ninto the gang if you ain't respectable, you know.\u201d\n\nHuck's joy was quenched.\n\n\u201cCan't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than what a\npirate is--as a general thing. In most countries they're awful high up in\nthe nobility--dukes and such.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't shet me\nout, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, _would_ you, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, I wouldn't want to, and I _don't_ want to--but what would people\nsay? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low characters in\nit!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that, and I wouldn't.\u201d\n\nHuck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he\nsaid:\n\n\u201cWell, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I\ncan come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll ask the\nwidow to let up on you a little, Huck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you, Tom--now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on some of\nthe roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd\nthrough or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the initiation\ntonight, maybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave the which?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave the initiation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang's\nsecrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and\nall his family that hurts one of the gang.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's gay--that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at midnight,\nin the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find--a ha'nted house is the\nbest, but they're all ripped up now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, midnight's good, anyway, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with\nblood.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, that's something _like_! Why, it's a million times bullier than\npirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be\na reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout it, I reckon\nshe'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.\u201d\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a _boy_, it\nmust stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the\nhistory of a _man_. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows\nexactly where to stop--that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of\njuveniles, he must stop where he best can.\n\nMost of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are\nprosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the\nstory of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they\nturned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that\npart of their lives at present.\n"
