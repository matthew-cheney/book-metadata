    "body": "\nAFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.\nThey went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft\nplace they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes\nthey would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly\nround white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a\nfamous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.\n\nAfter breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and\nchased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until\nthey were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal\nwater of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their\nlegs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.\nAnd now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each\nother's faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with\naverted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and\nstruggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all\nwent under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,\nsputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.\n\nWhen they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,\nhot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by\nbreak for the water again and go through the original performance once\nmore. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented\nflesh-colored \u201ctights\u201d very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and\nhad a circus--with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest\npost to his neighbor.\n\nNext they got their marbles and played \u201cknucks\u201d and \u201cringtaw\u201d and\n\u201ckeeps\u201d till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another\nswim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off\nhis trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his\nankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the\nprotection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he\nhad found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to\nrest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the \u201cdumps,\u201d and\nfell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay\ndrowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing \u201cBECKY\u201d in the sand with\nhis big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his\nweakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He\nerased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving\nthe other boys together and joining them.\n\nBut Joe's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so\nhomesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay\nvery near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,\nbut tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready\nto tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he\nwould have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:\n\n\u201cI bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll explore\nit again. They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you feel to light\non a rotten chest full of gold and silver--hey?\u201d\n\nBut it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.\nTom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was\ndiscouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking\nvery gloomy. Finally he said:\n\n\u201cOh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so lonesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by,\u201d said Tom. \u201cJust think of the\nfishing that's here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't care for fishing. I want to go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cSwimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when there\nain't anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I _do_ want to see my mother--and you would, too, if you had one. I\nain't any more baby than you are.\u201d And Joe snuffled a little.\n\n\u201cWell, we'll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won't we, Huck? Poor\nthing--does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here,\ndon't you, Huck? We'll stay, won't we?\u201d\n\nHuck said, \u201cY-e-s\u201d--without any heart in it.\n\n\u201cI'll never speak to you again as long as I live,\u201d said Joe, rising.\n\u201cThere now!\u201d And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.\n\n\u201cWho cares!\u201d said Tom. \u201cNobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get\nlaughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't crybabies. We'll\nstay, won't we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get\nalong without him, per'aps.\u201d\n\nBut Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly\non with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying\nJoe's preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.\nPresently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the\nIllinois shore. Tom's heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck\ncould not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:\n\n\u201cI want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now\nit'll be worse. Let's us go, too, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, I better go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, go 'long--who's hendering you.\u201d\n\nHuck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:\n\n\u201cTom, I wisht you'd come, too. Now you think it over. We'll wait for you\nwhen we get to shore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you'll wait a blame long time, that's all.\u201d\n\nHuck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a\nstrong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along\ntoo. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It\nsuddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made\none final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades,\nyelling:\n\n\u201cWait! Wait! I want to tell you something!\u201d\n\nThey presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they\nwere, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till\nat last they saw the \u201cpoint\u201d he was driving at, and then they set up a\nwarwhoop of applause and said it was \u201csplendid!\u201d and said if he had\ntold them at first, they wouldn't have started away. He made a plausible\nexcuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret\nwould keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had\nmeant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.\n\nThe lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,\nchattering all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and admiring the\ngenius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to\nlearn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to\ntry, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never\nsmoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they \u201cbit\u201d the\ntongue, and were not considered manly anyway.\n\nNow they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,\ncharily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,\nand they gagged a little, but Tom said:\n\n\u201cWhy, it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed this was all, I'd a learnt long\nago.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo would I,\u201d said Joe. \u201cIt's just nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish\nI could do that; but I never thought I could,\u201d said Tom.\n\n\u201cThat's just the way with me, hain't it, Huck? You've heard me talk just\nthat way--haven't you, Huck? I'll leave it to Huck if I haven't.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes--heaps of times,\u201d said Huck.\n\n\u201cWell, I have too,\u201d said Tom; \u201coh, hundreds of times. Once down by the\nslaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and\nJohnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don't you remember,\nHuck, 'bout me saying that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that's so,\u201d said Huck. \u201cThat was the day after I lost a white\nalley. No, 'twas the day before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere--I told you so,\u201d said Tom. \u201cHuck recollects it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,\u201d said Joe. \u201cI don't feel\nsick.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither do I,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff\nThatcher couldn't.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just let him\ntry it once. _He'd_ see!\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet he would. And Johnny Miller--I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle\nit once.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don't I!\u201d said Joe. \u201cWhy, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't any more\ndo this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.\u201d\n\n\u201c'Deed it would, Joe. Say--I wish the boys could see us now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo do I.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay--boys, don't say anything about it, and some time when they're\naround, I'll come up to you and say, 'Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.'\nAnd you'll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn't anything, you'll\nsay, 'Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain't\nvery good.' And I'll say, 'Oh, that's all right, if it's _strong_\nenough.' And then you'll out with the pipes, and we'll light up just as\nca'm, and then just see 'em look!\u201d\n\n\u201cBy jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo do I! And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating,\nwon't they wish they'd been along?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I reckon not! I'll just _bet_ they will!\u201d\n\nSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and\ngrow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously\nincreased. Every pore inside the boys' cheeks became a spouting\nfountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues\nfast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their\nthroats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings\nfollowed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,\nnow. Joe's pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom's followed. Both\nfountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and\nmain. Joe said feebly:\n\n\u201cI've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.\u201d\n\nTom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:\n\n\u201cI'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the spring.\nNo, you needn't come, Huck--we can find it.\u201d\n\nSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,\nand went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both\nvery pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had\nhad any trouble they had got rid of it.\n\nThey were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,\nand when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare\ntheirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well--something they ate\nat dinner had disagreed with them.\n\nAbout midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding\noppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys\nhuddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of\nthe fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was\nstifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.\nBeyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the\nblackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that\nvaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by\nanother came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came\nsighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting\nbreath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit\nof the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned\nnight into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and\ndistinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,\nstartled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling\ndown the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A\nsweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the\nflaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the\nforest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops\nright over the boys' heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick\ngloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.\n\n\u201cQuick! boys, go for the tent!\u201d exclaimed Tom.\n\nThey sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no\ntwo plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through\nthe trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after\nanother came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching\nrain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the\nground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the\nbooming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one\nthey straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,\nand streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something\nto be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so\nfuriously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest\nrose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its\nfastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each\nothers' hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter\nof a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its\nhighest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed\nin the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless\ndistinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the\ndriving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on\nthe other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting\nveil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight\nand fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging\nthunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,\nand unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort\nthat seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to\nthe treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one\nand the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be\nout in.\n\nBut at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and\nweaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The\nboys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still\nsomething to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter\nof their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were\nnot under it when the catastrophe happened.\n\nEverything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but\nheedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against\nrain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and\nchilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently\ndiscovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had\nbeen built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from\nthe ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they\npatiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under\nsides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they\npiled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were\ngladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,\nand after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their\nmidnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep\non, anywhere around.\n\nAs the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over\nthem, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got\nscorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After\nthe meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once\nmore. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as\nhe could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or\nanything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of\ncheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was\nto knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.\nThey were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were\nstripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many\nzebras--all of them chiefs, of course--and then they went tearing through\nthe woods to attack an English settlement.\n\nBy and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each\nother from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each\nother by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely\nsatisfactory one.\n\nThey assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now\na difficulty arose--hostile Indians could not break the bread of\nhospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple\nimpossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other\nprocess that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished\nthey had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such\nshow of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and\ntook their whiff as it passed, in due form.\n\nAnd behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had\ngained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without\nhaving to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to\nbe seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high\npromise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper,\nwith right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were\nprouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been\nin the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to\nsmoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at\npresent."
