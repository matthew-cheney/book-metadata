    "body": "\nTHAT was Tom's great secret--the scheme to return home with his brother\npirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the\nMissouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles\nbelow the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town\ntill nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys\nand finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of\ninvalided benches.\n\nAt breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to\nTom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of\ntalk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:\n\n\u201cWell, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody\nsuffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you\ncould be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over\non a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a\nhint some way that you warn't dead, but only run off.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you could have done that, Tom,\u201d said Mary; \u201cand I believe you\nwould if you had thought of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you, Tom?\u201d said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. \u201cSay,\nnow, would you, if you'd thought of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI--well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, I hoped you loved me that much,\u201d said Aunt Polly, with a grieved\ntone that discomforted the boy. \u201cIt would have been something if you'd\ncared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn't _do_ it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, auntie, that ain't any harm,\u201d pleaded Mary; \u201cit's only Tom's giddy\nway--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and\n_done_ it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's too late,\nand wish you'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so\nlittle.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, auntie, you know I do care for you,\u201d said Tom.\n\n\u201cI'd know it better if you acted more like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish now I'd thought,\u201d said Tom, with a repentant tone; \u201cbut I dreamt\nabout you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ain't much--a cat does that much--but it's better than nothing. What\ndid you dream?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the\nbed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could take even\nthat much trouble about us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, she was here! Did you dream any more?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, lots. But it's so dim, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, try to recollect--can't you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomehow it seems to me that the wind--the wind blowed the--the--\u201d\n\n\u201cTry harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!\u201d\n\nTom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then\nsaid:\n\n\u201cI've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!\u201d\n\n\u201cMercy on us! Go on, Tom--go on!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door--'\u201d\n\n\u201cGo _on_, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust let me study a moment--just a moment. Oh, yes--you said you believed\nthe door was open.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then--and then--well I won't be certain, but it seems like as if you\nmade Sid go and--and--\u201d\n\n\u201cWell? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made him--you--Oh, you made him shut it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my\ndays! Don't tell _me_ there ain't anything in dreams, any more. Sereny\nHarper shall know of this before I'm an hour older. I'd like to see her\nget around _this_ with her rubbage 'bout superstition. Go on, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn't\n_bad_, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible\nthan--than--I think it was a colt, or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then you began to cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then--\u201d\n\n\u201cThen Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and\nshe wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when she'd throwed it\nout her own self--\u201d\n\n\u201cTom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying--that's what you\nwas doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen Sid he said--he said--\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think I said anything,\u201d said Sid.\n\n\u201cYes you did, Sid,\u201d said Mary.\n\n\u201cShut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said--I _think_ he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone\nto, but if I'd been better sometimes--\u201d\n\n\u201c_There_, d'you hear that! It was his very words!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you shut him up sharp.\u201d\n\n\u201cI lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There _was_ an angel\nthere, somewheres!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you\ntold about Peter and the Pain-killer--\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as true as I live!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for us,\nand 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper\nhugged and cried, and she went.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm a-sitting in\nthese very tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more like if you'd 'a' seen\nit! And then what? Go on, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I thought you prayed for me--and I could see you and hear every\nword you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and\nwrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off being\npirates,' and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked\nso good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and\nkissed you on the lips.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you, Tom, _did_ you! I just forgive you everything for that!\u201d And\nshe seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the\nguiltiest of villains.\n\n\u201cIt was very kind, even though it was only a--dream,\u201d Sid soliloquized\njust audibly.\n\n\u201cShut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he was\nawake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you, Tom, if you\nwas ever found again--now go 'long to school. I'm thankful to the good\nGod and Father of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering and\nmerciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness\nknows I'm unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings\nand had His hand to help them over the rough places, there's few enough\nwould smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes.\nGo 'long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you've hendered me long\nenough.\u201d\n\nThe children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper\nand vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid had better\njudgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the\nhouse. It was this: \u201cPretty thin--as long a dream as that, without any\nmistakes in it!\u201d\n\nWhat a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,\nbut moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the\npublic eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see\nthe looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and\ndrink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud\nto be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer\nat the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into\ntown. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at\nall; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have\ngiven anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his\nglittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a\ncircus.\n\nAt school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered\nsuch eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were\nnot long in becoming insufferably \u201cstuck-up.\u201d They began to tell their\nadventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a\nthing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish\nmaterial. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely\npuffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.\n\nTom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory\nwas sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,\nmaybe she would be wanting to \u201cmake up.\u201d Well, let her--she should see\nthat he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she\narrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group\nof boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was\ntripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,\npretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter\nwhen she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her\ncaptures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye\nin his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity\nthat was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only \u201cset him up\u201d\n the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he\nknew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved\nirresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and\nwistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more\nparticularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang\nand grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her\nfeet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to\na girl almost at Tom's elbow--with sham vivacity:\n\n\u201cWhy, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to Sunday-school?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did come--didn't you see me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, no! Did you? Where did you sit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw _you_.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about\nthe picnic.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ma's going to let me have one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, goody; I hope she'll let _me_ come.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come that I\nwant, and I want you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's ever so nice. When is it going to be?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy and by. Maybe about vacation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, every one that's friends to me--or wants to be\u201d; and she glanced\never so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence\nabout the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the\ngreat sycamore tree \u201call to flinders\u201d while he was \u201cstanding within\nthree feet of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, may I come?\u201d said Grace Miller.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd me?\u201d said Sally Rogers.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd me, too?\u201d said Susy Harper. \u201cAnd Joe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAnd so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged\nfor invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still\ntalking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled and the tears\ncame to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on\nchattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of\neverything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and\nhad what her sex call \u201ca good cry.\u201d Then she sat moody, with wounded\npride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast\nin her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what\n_she'd_ do.\n\nAt recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant\nself-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate\nher with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden\nfalling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind\nthe schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple--and so\nabsorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,\nthat they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.\nJealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins. He began to hate himself for\nthrowing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He\ncalled himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He\nwanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,\nfor her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function. He\ndid not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly\nhe could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced\nas otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and\nagain, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could\nnot help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that\nBecky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the\nliving. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her\nfight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.\n\nAmy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had\nto attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in\nvain--the girl chirped on. Tom thought, \u201cOh, hang her, ain't I ever going\nto get rid of her?\u201d At last he must be attending to those things--and she\nsaid artlessly that she would be \u201caround\u201d when school let out. And he\nhastened away, hating her for it.\n\n\u201cAny other boy!\u201d Tom thought, grating his teeth. \u201cAny boy in the whole\ntown but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is\naristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this\ntown, mister, and I'll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you\nout! I'll just take and--\u201d\n\nAnd he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy--pummelling\nthe air, and kicking and gouging. \u201cOh, you do, do you? You holler\n'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!\u201d And so the imaginary\nflogging was finished to his satisfaction.\n\nTom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy's\ngrateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other\ndistress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the\nminutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to\ncloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed,\nand then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at\na footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew\nentirely miserable and wished she hadn't carried it so far. When\npoor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept\nexclaiming: \u201cOh, here's a jolly one! look at this!\u201d she lost patience at\nlast, and said, \u201cOh, don't bother me! I don't care for them!\u201d and burst\ninto tears, and got up and walked away.\n\nAlfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she\nsaid:\n\n\u201cGo away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!\u201d\n\nSo the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said\nshe would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on,\ncrying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was\nhumiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl\nhad simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.\nHe was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.\nHe wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much\nrisk to himself. Tom's spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his\nopportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and\npoured ink upon the page.\n\nBecky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,\nand moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,\nintending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their\ntroubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she\nhad changed her mind. The thought of Tom's treatment of her when she was\ntalking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.\nShe resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book's\naccount, and to hate him forever, into the bargain."
