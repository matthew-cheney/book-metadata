    "body": "\nTHE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful\nvillage like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family\nworship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid\ncourses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of\noriginality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of\nthe Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.\n\nThen Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to \u201cget\nhis verses.\u201d Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his\nenergies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the\nSermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.\nAt the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,\nbut no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human\nthought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took\nhis book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the\nfog:\n\n\u201cBlessed are the--a--a--\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor\u201d--\n\n\u201cYes--poor; blessed are the poor--a--a--\u201d\n\n\u201cIn spirit--\u201d\n\n\u201cIn spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they--they--\u201d\n\n\u201c_Theirs_--\u201d\n\n\u201cFor _theirs_. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom\nof heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they--they--\u201d\n\n\u201cSh--\u201d\n\n\u201cFor they--a--\u201d\n\n\u201cS, H, A--\u201d\n\n\u201cFor they S, H--Oh, I don't know what it is!\u201d\n\n\u201c_Shall_!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, _shall_! for they shall--for they shall--a--a--shall mourn--a--a--blessed\nare they that shall--they that--a--they that shall mourn, for they\nshall--a--shall _what_? Why don't you tell me, Mary?--what do you want to\nbe so mean for?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I'm not teasing you. I wouldn't\ndo that. You must go and learn it again. Don't you be discouraged, Tom,\nyou'll manage it--and if you do, I'll give you something ever so nice.\nThere, now, that's a good boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever you mind, Tom. You know if I say it's nice, it is nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet you that's so, Mary. All right, I'll tackle it again.\u201d\n\nAnd he did \u201ctackle it again\u201d--and under the double pressure of curiosity\nand prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a\nshining success. Mary gave him a brand-new \u201cBarlow\u201d knife worth twelve\nand a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system\nshook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,\nbut it was a \u201csure-enough\u201d Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur\nin that--though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a\nweapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing\nmystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the\ncupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was\ncalled off to dress for Sunday-school.\n\nMary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went\noutside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he\ndipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;\npoured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen\nand began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But\nMary removed the towel and said:\n\n\u201cNow ain't you ashamed, Tom. You mustn't be so bad. Water won't hurt\nyou.\u201d\n\nTom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he\nstood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath\nand began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut\nand groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of\nsuds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from\nthe towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped\nshort at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line\nthere was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in\nfront and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she\nwas done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of\ncolor, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls\nwrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately\nsmoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his\nhair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his\nown filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his\nclothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years--they were\nsimply called his \u201cother clothes\u201d--and so by that we know the size of his\nwardrobe. The girl \u201cput him to rights\u201d after he had dressed himself;\nshe buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt\ncollar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with\nhis speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and\nuncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there\nwas a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He\nhoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she\ncoated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought\nthem out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do\neverything he didn't want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:\n\n\u201cPlease, Tom--that's a good boy.\u201d\n\nSo he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three\nchildren set out for Sunday-school--a place that Tom hated with his whole\nheart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.\n\nSabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church\nservice. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,\nand the other always remained too--for stronger reasons. The church's\nhigh-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;\nthe edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board\ntree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step\nand accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:\n\n\u201cSay, Billy, got a yaller ticket?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat'll you take for her?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat'll you give?\u201d\n\n\u201cPiece of lickrish and a fish-hook.\u201d\n\n\u201cLess see 'em.\u201d\n\nTom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.\nThen Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some\nsmall trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other\nboys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten\nor fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm\nof clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started\na quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,\nelderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a\nboy's hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy\nturned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear\nhim say \u201cOuch!\u201d and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom's whole\nclass were of a pattern--restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came\nto recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but\nhad to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each\ngot his reward--in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture\non it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten\nblue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red\ntickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent\ngave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy\ntimes) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and\napplication to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And\nyet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way--it was the patient work of\ntwo years--and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once\nrecited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his\nmental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot\nfrom that day forth--a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great\noccasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it)\nhad always made this boy come out and \u201cspread himself.\u201d Only the older\npupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work\nlong enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes\nwas a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so\ngreat and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar's\nheart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple\nof weeks. It is possible that Tom's mental stomach had never really\nhungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being\nhad for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.\n\nIn due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with\na closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its\nleaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent\nmakes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as\nnecessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer\nwho stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert--though\nwhy, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music\nis ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim\ncreature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he\nwore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears\nand whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth--a\nfence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the\nwhole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a\nspreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had\nfringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion\nof the day, like sleigh-runners--an effect patiently and laboriously\nproduced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a\nwall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very\nsincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places\nin such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that\nunconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar\nintonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this\nfashion:\n\n\u201cNow, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as\nyou can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There--that\nis it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one\nlittle girl who is looking out of the window--I am afraid she thinks I\nam out there somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech\nto the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it\nmakes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a\nplace like this, learning to do right and be good.\u201d And so forth and so\non. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a\npattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.\n\nThe latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights\nand other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings\nand whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of\nisolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound\nceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters' voice, and the\nconclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.\n\nA good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was\nmore or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied\nby a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman\nwith iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's\nwife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of\nchafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too--he could not meet Amy\nLawrence's eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this\nsmall newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next\nmoment he was \u201cshowing off\u201d with all his might--cuffing boys, pulling\nhair, making faces--in a word, using every art that seemed likely to\nfascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one\nalloy--the memory of his humiliation in this angel's garden--and that\nrecord in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that\nwere sweeping over it now.\n\nThe visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.\nWalters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The\nmiddle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage--no less a one\nthan the county judge--altogether the most august creation these children\nhad ever looked upon--and they wondered what kind of material he was made\nof--and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,\ntoo. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away--so he had travelled,\nand seen the world--these very eyes had looked upon the county\ncourt-house--which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these\nreflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the\nranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of\ntheir own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar\nwith the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music\nto his soul to hear the whisperings:\n\n\u201cLook at him, Jim! He's a going up there. Say--look! he's a going to\nshake hands with him--he _is_ shaking hands with him! By jings, don't you\nwish you was Jeff?\u201d\n\nMr. Walters fell to \u201cshowing off,\u201d with all sorts of official bustlings\nand activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging\ndirections here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The\nlibrarian \u201cshowed off\u201d--running hither and thither with his arms full of\nbooks and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority\ndelights in. The young lady teachers \u201cshowed off\u201d--bending sweetly over\npupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers\nat bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen\nteachers \u201cshowed off\u201d with small scoldings and other little displays of\nauthority and fine attention to discipline--and most of the teachers, of\nboth sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was\nbusiness that frequently had to be done over again two or three times\n(with much seeming vexation). The little girls \u201cshowed off\u201d in various\nways, and the little boys \u201cshowed off\u201d with such diligence that the air\nwas thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it\nall the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all\nthe house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur--for he was\n\u201cshowing off,\u201d too.\n\nThere was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy complete,\nand that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.\nSeveral pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough--he had been\naround among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now,\nto have that German lad back again with a sound mind.\n\nAnd now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with\nnine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded\na Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not\nexpecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But\nthere was no getting around it--here were the certified checks, and they\nwere good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with\nthe Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from\nheadquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and\nso profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the\njudicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon\nin place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy--but those that\nsuffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they\nthemselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to\nTom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.\nThese despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a\nguileful snake in the grass.\n\nThe prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the\nsuperintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked\nsomewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct taught him\nthat there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,\nperhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two\nthousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises--a dozen would\nstrain his capacity, without a doubt.\n\nAmy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in\nher face--but he wouldn't look. She wondered; then she was just a grain\ntroubled; next a dim suspicion came and went--came again; she watched;\na furtive glance told her worlds--and then her heart broke, and she was\njealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most\nof all (she thought).\n\nTom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath\nwould hardly come, his heart quaked--partly because of the awful\ngreatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would\nhave liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The\nJudge put his hand on Tom's head and called him a fine little man, and\nasked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:\n\n\u201cTom.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, not Tom--it is--\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, that's it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That's very well.\nBut you've another one I daresay, and you'll tell it to me, won't you?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,\u201d said Walters, \u201cand say\nsir. You mustn't forget your manners.\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas Sawyer--sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's it! That's a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two\nthousand verses is a great many--very, very great many. And you never can\nbe sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth\nmore than anything there is in the world; it's what makes great men\nand good men; you'll be a great man and a good man yourself, some\nday, Thomas, and then you'll look back and say, It's all owing to the\nprecious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood--it's all owing to\nmy dear teachers that taught me to learn--it's all owing to the good\nsuperintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a\nbeautiful Bible--a splendid elegant Bible--to keep and have it all for my\nown, always--it's all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will\nsay, Thomas--and you wouldn't take any money for those two thousand\nverses--no indeed you wouldn't. And now you wouldn't mind telling me and\nthis lady some of the things you've learned--no, I know you wouldn't--for\nwe are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names\nof all the twelve disciples. Won't you tell us the names of the first\ntwo that were appointed?\u201d\n\nTom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,\nnow, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters' heart sank within him. He said\nto himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest\nquestion--why _did_ the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up\nand say:\n\n\u201cAnswer the gentleman, Thomas--don't be afraid.\u201d\n\nTom still hung fire.\n\n\u201cNow I know you'll tell me,\u201d said the lady. \u201cThe names of the first two\ndisciples were--\u201d\n\n\u201c_David And Goliah!_\u201d\n\nLet us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene."
