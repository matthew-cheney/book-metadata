    "body": "\nONE of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its secret\ntroubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest\nitself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had\nstruggled with his pride a few days, and tried to \u201cwhistle her down the\nwind,\u201d but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father's\nhouse, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she\nshould die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an\ninterest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there\nwas nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;\nthere was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to\ntry all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who\nare infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of\nproducing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in\nthese things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a\nfever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,\nbut on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the\n\u201cHealth\u201d periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance\nthey were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the \u201crot\u201d they\ncontained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,\nand what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and\nwhat frame of mind to keep one's self in, and what sort of clothing\nto wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her\nhealth-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they\nhad recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest\nas the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered\ntogether her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed\nwith death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with\n\u201chell following after.\u201d But she never suspected that she was not an\nangel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering\nneighbors.\n\nThe water treatment was new, now, and Tom's low condition was a windfall\nto her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the\nwood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed\nhim down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she\nrolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she\nsweated his soul clean and \u201cthe yellow stains of it came through his\npores\u201d--as Tom said.\n\nYet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and\npale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and\nplunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the\nwater with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his\ncapacity as she would a jug's, and filled him up every day with quack\ncure-alls.\n\nTom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase\nfilled the old lady's heart with consternation. This indifference must\nbe broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first\ntime. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with\ngratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water\ntreatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.\nShe gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the\nresult. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;\nfor the \u201cindifference\u201d was broken up. The boy could not have shown a\nwilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.\n\nTom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be\nromantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have\ntoo little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he\nthought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of\nprofessing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he\nbecame a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and\nquit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings\nto alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle\nclandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it\ndid not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in\nthe sitting-room floor with it.\n\nOne day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's yellow\ncat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging\nfor a taste. Tom said:\n\n\u201cDon't ask for it unless you want it, Peter.\u201d\n\nBut Peter signified that he did want it.\n\n\u201cYou better make sure.\u201d\n\nPeter was sure.\n\n\u201cNow you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't\nanything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it, you mustn't\nblame anybody but your own self.\u201d\n\nPeter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down\nthe Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then\ndelivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging\nagainst furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next\nhe rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,\nwith his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his\nunappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again\nspreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time\nto see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,\nand sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots\nwith him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over\nher glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.\n\n\u201cTom, what on earth ails that cat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know, aunt,\u201d gasped the boy.\n\n\u201cWhy, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?\u201d\n\n\u201cDeed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're having a\ngood time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do, do they?\u201d There was something in the tone that made Tom\napprehensive.\n\n\u201cYes'm. That is, I believe they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou _do_?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes'm.\u201d\n\nThe old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized\nby anxiety. Too late he divined her \u201cdrift.\u201d The handle of the telltale\ntea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it\nup. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual\nhandle--his ear--and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.\n\n\u201cNow, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI done it out of pity for him--because he hadn't any aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cHadn't any aunt!--you numskull. What has that got to do with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHeaps. Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt him out herself! She'd a\nroasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling than if he was a\nhuman!\u201d\n\nAunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in\na new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too.\nShe began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she\nput her hand on Tom's head and said gently:\n\n\u201cI was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.\u201d\n\nTom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping\nthrough his gravity.\n\n\u201cI know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It\ndone _him_ good, too. I never see him get around so since--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try\nand see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you needn't take any\nmore medicine.\u201d\n\nTom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing\nhad been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,\nhe hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his\ncomrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to\nbe looking everywhere but whither he really was looking--down the road.\nPresently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom's face lighted; he gazed\na moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom\naccosted him; and \u201cled up\u201d warily to opportunities for remark about\nBecky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and\nwatched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the\nowner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks\nceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered\nthe empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed\nin at the gate, and Tom's heart gave a great bound. The next instant he\nwas out, and \u201cgoing on\u201d like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,\njumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,\nstanding on his head--doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,\nand keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher\nwas noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never\nlooked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?\nHe carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping\naround, snatched a boy's cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,\nbroke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and\nfell sprawling, himself, under Becky's nose, almost upsetting her--and\nshe turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: \u201cMf! some\npeople think they're mighty smart--always showing off!\u201d\n\nTom's cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and\ncrestfallen."
