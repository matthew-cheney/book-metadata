    "body": "\nTOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the\ntrack of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed\na small \u201cbranch\u201d two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile\nsuperstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later\nhe was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff\nHill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the\nvalley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to\nthe centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.\nThere was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even\nstilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken\nby no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and\nthis seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the\nmore profound. The boy's soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings\nwere in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows\non his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him\nthat life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy\nHodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie\nand slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through\nthe trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and\nnothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a\nclean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with\nit all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant\nthe best in the world, and been treated like a dog--like a very dog. She\nwould be sorry some day--maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only\ndie _temporarily_!\n\nBut the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained\nshape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into\nthe concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and\ndisappeared mysteriously? What if he went away--ever so far away, into\nunknown countries beyond the seas--and never came back any more! How\nwould she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only\nto fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights\nwere an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was\nexalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be\na soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.\nNo--better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on\nthe warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the\nFar West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with\nfeathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy\nsummer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs\nof all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was\nsomething gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it!\n_now_ his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable\nsplendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!\nHow gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,\nblack-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying\nat the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear\nat the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in\nhis black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson\nsash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass\nat his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,\nwith the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy\nthe whisperings, \u201cIt's Tom Sawyer the Pirate!--the Black Avenger of the\nSpanish Main!\u201d\n\nYes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from\nhome and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore\nhe must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.\nHe went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of\nit with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He\nput his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:\n\n\u201cWhat hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!\u201d\n\nThen he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it\nup and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides\nwere of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom's astonishment was bound-less!\nHe scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:\n\n\u201cWell, that beats anything!\u201d\n\nThen he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The\ntruth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and\nall his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried\na marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a\nfortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just\nused, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered\nthemselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been\nseparated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.\nTom's whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had\nmany a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing\nbefore. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times\nbefore, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He\npuzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch\nhad interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself\non that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot\nwith a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and\nput his mouth close to this depression and called--\n\n\u201cDoodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,\ndoodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!\u201d\n\nThe sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a\nsecond and then darted under again in a fright.\n\n\u201cHe dasn't tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.\u201d\n\nHe well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he\ngave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have\nthe marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a\npatient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his\ntreasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing\nwhen he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his\npocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:\n\n\u201cBrother, go find your brother!\u201d\n\nHe watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must\nhave fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last\nrepetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each\nother.\n\nJust here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green\naisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned\na suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,\ndisclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and\nin a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,\nwith fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an\nanswering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way\nand that. He said cautiously--to an imaginary company:\n\n\u201cHold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.\u201d\n\nNow appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.\nTom called:\n\n\u201cHold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?\u201d\n\n\u201cGuy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou that--that--\u201d\n\n\u201cDares to hold such language,\u201d said Tom, prompting--for they talked \u201cby\nthe book,\u201d from memory.\n\n\u201cWho art thou that dares to hold such language?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute\nwith thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!\u201d\n\nThey took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,\nstruck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful\ncombat, \u201ctwo up and two down.\u201d Presently Tom said:\n\n\u201cNow, if you've got the hang, go it lively!\u201d\n\nSo they \u201cwent it lively,\u201d panting and perspiring with the work. By and\nby Tom shouted:\n\n\u201cFall! fall! Why don't you fall?\u201d\n\n\u201cI sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the worst of\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in the\nbook. The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy\nof Guisborne.' You're to turn around and let me hit you in the back.\u201d\n\nThere was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the\nwhack and fell.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Joe, getting up, \u201cyou got to let me kill _you_. That's\nfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I can't do that, it ain't in the book.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it's blamed mean--that's all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son, and lam\nme with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be\nRobin Hood a little while and kill me.\u201d\n\nThis was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then\nTom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to\nbleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,\nrepresenting a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,\ngave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, \u201cWhere this arrow\nfalls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.\u201d Then he\nshot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle\nand sprang up too gaily for a corpse.\n\nThe boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off\ngrieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern\ncivilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.\nThey said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than\nPresident of the United States forever."
