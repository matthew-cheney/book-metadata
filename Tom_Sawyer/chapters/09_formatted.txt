    "body": "\nAT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.\nThey said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and\nwaited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be\nnearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He\nwould have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was\nafraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.\nEverything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,\nscarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking\nof the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack\nmysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.\nA measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly's chamber. And now the\ntiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,\nbegan. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the\nbed's head made Tom shudder--it meant that somebody's days were numbered.\nThen the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered\nby a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last\nhe was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to\ndoze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear\nit. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most\nmelancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed\nhim. A cry of \u201cScat! you devil!\u201d and the crash of an empty bottle\nagainst the back of his aunt's woodshed brought him wide awake, and a\nsingle minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping\nalong the roof of the \u201cell\u201d on all fours. He \u201cmeow'd\u201d with caution once\nor twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence\nto the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys\nmoved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they\nwere wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.\n\nIt was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,\nabout a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence\naround it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the\ntime, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the\nwhole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a\ntombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over\nthe graves, leaning for support and finding none. \u201cSacred to the memory\nof\u201d So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have\nbeen read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.\n\nA faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the\nspirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked\nlittle, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the\npervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the\nsharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the\nprotection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of\nthe grave.\n\nThen they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of\na distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom's\nreflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a\nwhisper:\n\n\u201cHucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?\u201d\n\nHuckleberry whispered:\n\n\u201cI wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, _ain't_ it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet it is.\u201d\n\nThere was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter\ninwardly. Then Tom whispered:\n\n\u201cSay, Hucky--do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?\u201d\n\n\u201cO' course he does. Least his sperrit does.\u201d\n\nTom, after a pause:\n\n\u201cI wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody\ncalls him Hoss.\u201d\n\n\u201cA body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead\npeople, Tom.\u201d\n\nThis was a damper, and conversation died again.\n\nPresently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said:\n\n\u201cSh!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Tom?\u201d And the two clung together with beating hearts.\n\n\u201cSh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI--\u201d\n\n\u201cThere! Now you hear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, Tom, they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dono. Think they'll see us?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn't\ncome.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don't be afeard. I don't believe they'll bother us. We ain't doing\nany harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't notice us at\nall.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d\n\nThe boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled\nsound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.\n\n\u201cLook! See there!\u201d whispered Tom. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.\u201d\n\nSome vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an\nold-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable\nlittle spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a\nshudder:\n\n\u201cIt's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're goners!\nCan you pray?\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us. 'Now I\nlay me down to sleep, I--'\u201d\n\n\u201cSh!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey're _humans_! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff Potter's\nvoice.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo--'tain't so, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp enough to\nnotice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely--blamed old rip!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it. Here they\ncome again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They're\np'inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o' them voices; it's\nInjun Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's so--that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was devils a dern\nsight. What kin they be up to?\u201d\n\nThe whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the\ngrave and stood within a few feet of the boys' hiding-place.\n\n\u201cHere it is,\u201d said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern\nup and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.\n\nPotter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple\nof shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.\nThe doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat\ndown with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the\nboys could have touched him.\n\n\u201cHurry, men!\u201d he said, in a low voice; \u201cthe moon might come out at any\nmoment.\u201d\n\nThey growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no\nnoise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of\nmould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon\nthe coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two\nthe men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with\ntheir shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The\nmoon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.\nThe barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a\nblanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large\nspring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:\n\n\u201cNow the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out with\nanother five, or here she stays.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's the talk!\u201d said Injun Joe.\n\n\u201cLook here, what does this mean?\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYou required your\npay in advance, and I've paid you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and you done more than that,\u201d said Injun Joe, approaching the\ndoctor, who was now standing. \u201cFive years ago you drove me away from\nyour father's kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to\neat, and you said I warn't there for any good; and when I swore I'd get\neven with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for\na vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The Injun blood ain't in me for\nnothing. And now I've _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!\u201d\n\nHe was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.\nThe doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.\nPotter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:\n\n\u201cHere, now, don't you hit my pard!\u201d and the next moment he had grappled\nwith the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,\ntrampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe\nsprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter's\nknife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about\nthe combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung\nhimself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams' grave and felled\nPotter to the earth with it--and in the same instant the half-breed saw\nhis chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man's breast. He\nreeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in\nthe same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the\ntwo frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.\n\nPresently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the\ntwo forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave\na long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:\n\n\u201c_That_ score is settled--damn you.\u201d\n\nThen he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter's\nopen right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three--four--five\nminutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed\nupon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a\nshudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and\nthen around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe's.\n\n\u201cLord, how is this, Joe?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt's a dirty business,\u201d said Joe, without moving.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do it for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI! I never done it!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook here! That kind of talk won't wash.\u201d\n\nPotter trembled and grew white.\n\n\u201cI thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But it's\nin my head yet--worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle;\ncan't recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe--_honest_, now,\nold feller--did I do it? Joe, I never meant to--'pon my soul and honor, I\nnever meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it's awful--and him so\nyoung and promising.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard\nand you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering\nlike, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched\nyou another awful clip--and here you've laid, as dead as a wedge til\nnow.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I\ndid. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.\nI never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I've fought, but never\nwith weepons. They'll all say that. Joe, don't tell! Say you won't tell,\nJoe--that's a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you,\ntoo. Don't you remember? You _won't_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?\u201d And the\npoor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and\nclasped his appealing hands.\n\n\u201cNo, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I\nwon't go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can say.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest day I\nlive.\u201d And Potter began to cry.\n\n\u201cCome, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering.\nYou be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and don't leave any\ntracks behind you.\u201d\n\nPotter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed\nstood looking after him. He muttered:\n\n\u201cIf he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he\nhad the look of being, he won't think of the knife till he's gone so\nfar he'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by\nhimself--chicken-heart!\u201d\n\nTwo or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the\nlidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the\nmoon's. The stillness was complete again, too."
