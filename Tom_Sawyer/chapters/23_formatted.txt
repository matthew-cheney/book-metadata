    "body": "\nAT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred--and vigorously: the murder\ntrial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village\ntalk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to\nthe murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience\nand fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in\nhis hearing as \u201cfeelers\u201d; he did not see how he could be suspected of\nknowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable\nin the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.\nHe took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some\nrelief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of\ndistress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself\nthat Huck had remained discreet.\n\n\u201cHuck, have you ever told anybody about--that?\u201d\n\n\u201c'Bout what?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh--'course I haven't.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever a word?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I was afeard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got found out.\n_You_ know that.\u201d\n\nTom felt more comfortable. After a pause:\n\n\u201cHuck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they\ncould get me to tell. They ain't no different way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we keep\nmum. But let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm agreed.\u201d\n\nSo they swore again with dread solemnities.\n\n\u201cWhat is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the\ntime. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to hide som'ers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a goner.\nDon't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?\u201d\n\n\u201cMost always--most always. He ain't no account; but then he hain't ever\ndone anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to\nget drunk on--and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do\nthat--leastways most of us--preachers and such like. But he's kind of\ngood--he give me half a fish, once, when there warn't enough for two; and\nlots of times he's kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line.\nI wish we could get him out of there.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy! we couldn't get him out, Tom. And besides, 'twouldn't do any good;\nthey'd ketch him again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes--so they would. But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the dickens\nwhen he never done--that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain\nin this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say that if he\nwas to get free they'd lynch him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they'd do it, too.\u201d\n\nThe boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the\ntwilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood\nof the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that\nsomething would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But\nnothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in\nthis luckless captive.\n\nThe boys did as they had often done before--went to the cell grating and\ngave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and\nthere were no guards.\n\nHis gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences\nbefore--it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and\ntreacherous to the last degree when Potter said:\n\n\u201cYou've been mighty good to me, boys--better'n anybody else in this town.\nAnd I don't forget it, I don't. Often I says to myself, says I, 'I used\nto mend all the boys' kites and things, and show 'em where the good\nfishin' places was, and befriend 'em what I could, and now they've\nall forgot old Muff when he's in trouble; but Tom don't, and Huck\ndon't--_they_ don't forget him, says I, 'and I don't forget them.' Well,\nboys, I done an awful thing--drunk and crazy at the time--that's the only\nway I account for it--and now I got to swing for it, and it's right.\nRight, and _best_, too, I reckon--hope so, anyway. Well, we won't talk\nabout that. I don't want to make _you_ feel bad; you've befriended me.\nBut what I want to say, is, don't _you_ ever get drunk--then you won't\never get here. Stand a litter furder west--so--that's it; it's a prime\ncomfort to see faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck\nof trouble, and there don't none come here but yourn. Good friendly\nfaces--good friendly faces. Git up on one another's backs and let me\ntouch 'em. That's it. Shake hands--yourn'll come through the bars, but\nmine's too big. Little hands, and weak--but they've helped Muff Potter a\npower, and they'd help him more if they could.\u201d\n\nTom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.\nThe next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an\nalmost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.\nHuck was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other.\nEach wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination\nalways brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers\nsauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing\nnews--the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor\nPotter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect\nthat Injun Joe's evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was\nnot the slightest question as to what the jury's verdict would be.\n\nTom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He\nwas in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to\nsleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for\nthis was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented\nin the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took\ntheir places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and\nhopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all\nthe curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,\nstolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and\nthe sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings\namong the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These\ndetails and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation\nthat was as impressive as it was fascinating.\n\nNow a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing\nin the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was\ndiscovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further\nquestioning, counsel for the prosecution said:\n\n\u201cTake the witness.\u201d\n\nThe prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when\nhis own counsel said:\n\n\u201cI have no questions to ask him.\u201d\n\nThe next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.\nCounsel for the prosecution said:\n\n\u201cTake the witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no questions to ask him,\u201d Potter's lawyer replied.\n\nA third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's\npossession.\n\n\u201cTake the witness.\u201d\n\nCounsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience\nbegan to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his\nclient's life without an effort?\n\nSeveral witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior when\nbrought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand\nwithout being cross-questioned.\n\nEvery detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the\ngraveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was\nbrought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined\nby Potter's lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house\nexpressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.\nCounsel for the prosecution now said:\n\n\u201cBy the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have\nfastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the\nunhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.\u201d\n\nA groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and\nrocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned\nin the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many women's compassion\ntestified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:\n\n\u201cYour honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we\nforeshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed\nwhile under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced\nby drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.\u201d [Then\nto the clerk:] \u201cCall Thomas Sawyer!\u201d\n\nA puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting\nPotter's. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as\nhe rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough,\nfor he was badly scared. The oath was administered.\n\n\u201cThomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the\nhour of midnight?\u201d\n\nTom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed him. The\naudience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few\nmoments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed\nto put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:\n\n\u201cIn the graveyard!\u201d\n\n\u201cA little bit louder, please. Don't be afraid. You were--\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the graveyard.\u201d\n\nA contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe's face.\n\n\u201cWere you anywhere near Horse Williams' grave?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak up--just a trifle louder. How near were you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNear as I am to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you hidden, or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was hid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cBehind the elms that's on the edge of the grave.\u201d\n\nInjun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.\n\n\u201cAny one with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. I went there with--\u201d\n\n\u201cWait--wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion's name. We\nwill produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with\nyou.\u201d\n\nTom hesitated and looked confused.\n\n\u201cSpeak out, my boy--don't be diffident. The truth is always respectable.\nWhat did you take there?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly a--a--dead cat.\u201d\n\nThere was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.\n\n\u201cWe will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us\neverything that occurred--tell it in your own way--don't skip anything,\nand don't be afraid.\u201d\n\nTom began--hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his\nwords flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased\nbut his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and\nbated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,\nrapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent\nemotion reached its climax when the boy said:\n\n\u201c--and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun\nJoe jumped with the knife and--\u201d\n\nCrash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his\nway through all opposers, and was gone!"
