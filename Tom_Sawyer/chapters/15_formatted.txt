    "body": "\nA few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward\nthe Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway\nover; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out\nconfidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering\nupstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had\nexpected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till\nhe found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket\npocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,\nfollowing the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten\no'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the\nferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything\nwas quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching\nwith all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes\nand climbed into the skiff that did \u201cyawl\u201d duty at the boat's stern. He\nlaid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.\n\nPresently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to \u201ccast\noff.\u201d A minute or two later the skiff's head was standing high up,\nagainst the boat's swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in\nhis success, for he knew it was the boat's last trip for the night. At\nthe end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and\nTom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards\ndownstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.\n\nHe flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his\naunt's back fence. He climbed over, approached the \u201cell,\u201d and looked\nin at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There\nsat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother, grouped together,\ntalking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the\ndoor. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then\nhe pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing\ncautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might\nsqueeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,\nwarily.\n\n\u201cWhat makes the candle blow so?\u201d said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. \u201cWhy,\nthat door's open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange\nthings now. Go 'long and shut it, Sid.\u201d\n\nTom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and \u201cbreathed\u201d\n himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his\naunt's foot.\n\n\u201cBut as I was saying,\u201d said Aunt Polly, \u201che warn't _bad_, so to say--only\nmisch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn't\nany more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was\nthe best-hearted boy that ever was\u201d--and she began to cry.\n\n\u201cIt was just so with my Joe--always full of his devilment, and up to\nevery kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he\ncould be--and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking\nthat cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because\nit was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never,\nnever, poor abused boy!\u201d And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would\nbreak.\n\n\u201cI hope Tom's better off where he is,\u201d said Sid, \u201cbut if he'd been\nbetter in some ways--\u201d\n\n\u201c_Sid!_\u201d Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye, though he could not\nsee it. \u201cNot a word against my Tom, now that he's gone! God'll take care\nof _him_--never you trouble _your_self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don't\nknow how to give him up! I don't know how to give him up! He was such a\ncomfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, 'most.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away--Blessed be the name of\nthe Lord! But it's so hard--Oh, it's so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe\nbusted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.\nLittle did I know then, how soon--Oh, if it was to do over again I'd hug\nhim and bless him for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just\nexactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took\nand filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would\ntear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom's head with my\nthimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he's out of all his troubles now.\nAnd the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach--\u201d\n\nBut this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely\ndown. Tom was snuffling, now, himself--and more in pity of himself than\nanybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word\nfor him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself\nthan ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt's grief\nto long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy--and\nthe theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his\nnature, too, but he resisted and lay still.\n\nHe went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was\nconjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;\nthen the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing\nlads had promised that the village should \u201chear something\u201d soon; the\nwise-heads had \u201cput this and that together\u201d and decided that the lads\nhad gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,\npresently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the\nMissouri shore some five or six miles below the village--and then hope\nperished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home\nby nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the\nbodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must\nhave occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would\notherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies\ncontinued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the\nfunerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.\n\nMrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a\nmutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other's\narms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was\ntender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid\nsnuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.\n\nAunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,\nand with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,\nthat he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.\n\nHe had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making\nbroken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and\nturning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her\nsleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the\ncandle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full\nof pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the\ncandle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.\nHis face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark\nhastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and\nstraightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.\n\nHe threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large\nthere, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was\ntenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and\nslept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped\ninto it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a\nmile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself\nstoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for\nthis was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture\nthe skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore\nlegitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be\nmade for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and\nentered the woods.\n\nHe sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep\nawake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far\nspent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the\nisland bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the\ngreat river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A\nlittle later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and\nheard Joe say:\n\n\u201cNo, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't desert. He\nknows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's too proud for that\nsort of thing. He's up to something or other. Now I wonder what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain't\nback here to breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich he is!\u201d exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping\ngrandly into camp.\n\nA sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the\nboys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.\nThey were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.\nThen Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the\nother pirates got ready to fish and explore."
