    "body": "\nTHAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about\nthe neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley\nat a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or\nleft it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern\ndoor. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the\nunderstanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck\nwas to come and \u201cmaow,\u201d whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.\nBut the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to\nbed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.\n\nTuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday\nnight promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt's\nold tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the\nlantern in Huck's sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before\nmidnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)\nwere put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the\nalley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned,\nthe perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of\ndistant thunder.\n\nTom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the\ntowel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.\nHuck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was\na season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck's spirits like a\nmountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern--it\nwould frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive\nyet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have\nfainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and\nexcitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer\nand closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and\nmomentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away\nhis breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to\ninhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the\nway it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came\ntearing by him: \u201cRun!\u201d said he; \u201crun, for your life!\u201d\n\nHe needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or\nforty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never\nstopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the\nlower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm\nburst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:\n\n\u201cHuck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;\nbut they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly\nget my breath I was so scared. They wouldn't turn in the lock, either.\nWell, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and\nopen comes the door! It warn't locked! I hopped in, and shook off the\ntowel, and, _Great Caesar's Ghost!_\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!--what'd you see, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch\non his eye and his arms spread out.\u201d\n\n\u201cLordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and\nstarted!\u201d\n\n\u201cI'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, Tom, did you see that box?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't see\nthe cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor\nby Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.\nDon't you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have\ngot a ha'nted room, hey, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But\nsay, Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe's\ndrunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, that! You try it!\u201d\n\nHuck shuddered.\n\n\u201cWell, no--I reckon not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain't\nenough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it.\u201d\n\nThere was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:\n\n\u201cLookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun\nJoe's not in there. It's too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we'll\nbe dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we'll\nsnatch that box quicker'n lightning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do it every\nnight, too, if you'll do the other part of the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a\nblock and maow--and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window\nand that'll fetch me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed, and good as wheat!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to be\ndaylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every night for\na year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap's nigger man,\nUncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any\ntime I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.\nThat's a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don't ever act as\nif I was above him. Sometime I've set right down and eat _with_ him. But\nyou needn't tell that. A body's got to do things when he's awful hungry\nhe wouldn't want to do as a steady thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I won't\ncome bothering around. Any time you see something's up, in the night,\njust skip right around and maow.\u201d"
