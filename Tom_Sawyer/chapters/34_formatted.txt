The window ain't\nhigh from the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cShucks! what do you want to slope for?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I ain't used to that kind of a crowd. I can't stand it. I ain't\ngoing down there, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, bother! It ain't anything. I don't mind it a bit. I'll take care of\nyou.\u201d\n\nSid appeared.\n\n\u201cTom,\u201d said he, \u201cauntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary\ngot your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's been fretting about you.\nSay--ain't this grease and clay, on your clothes?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's all this\nblowout about, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This time\nit's for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they\nhelped her out of the other night. And say--I can tell you something, if\nyou want to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people\nhere tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a\nsecret, but I reckon it's not much of a secret now. Everybody knows--the\nwidow, too, for all she tries to let on she don't. Mr. Jones was bound\nHuck should be here--couldn't get along with his grand secret without\nHuck, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cSecret about what, Sid?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr. Jones was\ngoing to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop\npretty flat.\u201d\n\nSid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.\n\n\u201cSid, was it you that told?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, never mind who it was. _Somebody_ told--that's enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cSid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and\nthat's you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a' sneaked down the\nhill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can't do any but mean\nthings, and you can't bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.\nThere--no thanks, as the widow says\u201d--and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and helped\nhim to the door with several kicks. \u201cNow go and tell auntie if you\ndare--and tomorrow you'll catch it!\u201d\n\nSome minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper-table, and a\ndozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,\nafter the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.\nJones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the\nhonor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was\nanother person whose modesty--\n\nAnd so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck's share in\nthe adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the\nsurprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and\neffusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,\nthe widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many\ncompliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot\nthe nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely\nintolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody's gaze\nand everybody's laudations.\n\nThe widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him\neducated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in\nbusiness in a modest way. Tom's chance was come. He said:\n\n\u201cHuck don't need it. Huck's rich.\u201d\n\nNothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept\nback the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But\nthe silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:\n\n\u201cHuck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots of it.\nOh, you needn't smile--I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.\u201d\n\nTom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed\ninterest--and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.\n\n\u201cSid, what ails Tom?\u201d said Aunt Polly. \u201cHe--well, there ain't ever any\nmaking of that boy out. I never--\u201d\n\nTom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly\ndid not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the\ntable and said:\n\n\u201cThere--what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of it's mine!\u201d\n\nThe spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for\na moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said\nhe could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of\ninterest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the\ncharm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:\n\n\u201cI thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it\ndon't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I'm\nwilling to allow.\u201d\n\nThe money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand\ndollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time\nbefore, though several persons were there who were worth considerably\nmore than that in property."
