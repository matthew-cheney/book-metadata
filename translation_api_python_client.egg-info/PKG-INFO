Description:     ### Introduction
        
        Translation API is a tool that automatically translates text from one language to another.
        
        The source text is the text to be translated. The source language is the language that the source text is written in. The target language is the language that the source text is translated into.
        
        This document is intended for developers who want to write applications that can interact with the Translation API. You can use the Translation API to programmatically translate text on your webpages or apps.
        
        You need an API Key to use Translate API.
        
        
        ### Cross Domain
        
        Translation API supports cross-domain requests through the JSONP or the CORS mechanism.
        
        Translation API also supports the Silverlight client access policy file (clientaccesspolicy.xml) and the Adobe Flash cross-domain policy file (crossdomain.xml) that handles cross-domain requests.
        
        #### JSONP Support
        
        Translation API supports JSONP by providing the name of the callback function as a parameter. The response body will be contained in the parentheses:
        
        ```javascript
        callbackFunctionName(/* response body as defined in each API section */);
        ```
        #### CORS
        
        Translation API supports the CORS mechanism to handle cross-domain requests. The server will correctly handle the OPTIONS requests used by CORS.
        
        The following headers are set as follows:
        
        ```
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
        Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With,Content-Type,X-HTTP-METHOD-OVERRIDE
        ```
        
        ### Langage Code Values
        
        The language codes to be used are the two-letter codes defined by the ISO 639-1:2002, Codes for the representation of names of languages - Part 1: Alpha-2 code standard.
        
        Refer to the column &#39;ISO 639-1 code&#39; of this list: http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php.
        
        In addition to this list, the following codes are used:
        
        Language Code |	Language
        --------------|---------
        auto | Language Detection
        tj | Tajik (cyrillic script)
        zh-Hans | Chinese (Simplified)
        zh-Hant |	Chinese (Traditional)
        
        
        ### Escape input text
        
        The input text passed as a URL parameter will be escaped with an equivalent of the javascript &#39;encodeURIComponent&#39; function.
        
        ### Encoding of the input text
        
        The input text must be encoded in UTF-8.
        
        ### Encoding of the output text
        
        The output text (translated text, error and warning strings) will be encoded in UTF-8.
